1,2,ECB to appoint separate coaches for red-ball and white-ball formats ,"The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has invited applications for two head coaches after sacking Chris Silverwood following the national team’s disastrous campaign in the Ashes. The England cricketing setup has undergone plenty of changes following the 0-4 loss to Pat Cummins’ Australia Down Under.Yorkshire-born Joe Root has stepped down as the Three Lions’ Test skipper after the away series against the West Indies. After Silverwood’s departure, the ECB appointed former all-rounder Paul Collingwood as the interim head coach.Earlier, retired batter Rob Key was also named as the managing director of the men’s team. The changes have come to the fore after the Brits have won only one of their last 17 Tests.""The head coaches will report to Robert Key, the managing director of England men's cricket, and will have overall responsibility for the performance and management of the England men's team in the relevant formats covered by the roles,"" the advertisement read.Recently, Ravi Shastri, the former head coach of the Indian team, showed Key the blueprint to succeed during his stint with the England team. Key worked as a commentator before taking up the job at the ECB.""Rob may have more work with the domestic game but, when it comes to the national team, it is very similar. The most important thing is getting among the players and setting a tone from the outset: what you believe in, what you think of them and changing the mindset to compete and win.“You have to be bullish and brutish in wanting to achieve that. For us, and now England, it was about setting the challenge of winning abroad, big time,"" Shastri was quoted as saying.England employed the double head coach formula between 2012 and 2014.

2,3,Fact Check: 2020 video shared with false claim that Muslims offered loud prayers on streets after clampdown on loudspeakers in UP,"Recently, the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government ordered places of worship to lower the volumes of loudspeakers. Speakers were also removed from 125 places, as per the Additional Director General (Law and Order) of the UP Police. In its aftermath, a video of Muslim men standing on a road while offering prayers loudly went viral with the claim that this was in response to Adityanath’s orders.A Sudarshan News journalist tweeted the video, asking if shouting prayers, as seen in the video, was an alternative to loudspeakers. The video was also shared by the official Sudarshan News Twitter account, at least twice.The Sudarshan News Twitter account also called it an alternative to bans on loudspeakers.

A comparison with a photo of a Kolkata pavement railing carried by Ei Samay, a Bengali-language daily from the Times Group can be seen below.We also noticed the signage of a Biryani Shop named ""Shimla Biryani"" written in Bangla in the video, hinting that this video was likely from West Bengal.Dr. Rai confirmed to India Today that the viral video was from Pilkhana in Howrah. He explained that the video was from when all places of worship, including mosques, were shut down during the first 21-day phase of the national lockdown imposed to combat Covid-19.While we couldn't pinpoint the exact date on which the video was recorded, we concluded that this 2020 video from Howrah was definitely not in response to the recent clampdown on loudspeakers in UP.The number of crows determines the intensity of the lie.",2022-04-27,"Fact Check: 2020 video shared with false claim that Muslims offered loud prayers on streets after clampdown on loudspeakers in UPRecently, the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government ordered places of worship to lower the volumes of loudspeakers.

India belongs to the second category. India has maintained that it is on the side of peace and appealed to both Russia and Ukraine to end the war; however, it has consistently abstained from taking an explicit position against either of the two countries at war.In an exclusive interview with India Today’s Rajdeep Sardesai, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Wednesday that neutrality is a position that does not help in stopping the war.Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba), Ukraine's Foreign Minister speaks of the challenges that the Ukrainian troops face against relentless Russian attacks.'I know that #India enjoys a special relationship with #Russia, but this Russia is different', He also said@sardesairajdeep pic.twitter.com/swUIqQOfNsHe said, “We appreciate the sympathy coming from the leadership of India for Ukraine. We also appreciate the position of India that the war must stop. At the same time, I must mention that under these circumstances, neutrality is the position that doesn’t help in stopping the war. The best way to stop the war is to support Ukraine and leave Russia with no illusions that it may win the war.”“So, in my view, in times when you have an obvious criminal and a victim of his crime, it’s a moral and politically wise duty to be on the side of the victim,” he added.Recognising that India shares an important relationship with Russia, Dmytro Kuleba said, ""One point should be taken into account. This Russia is different from the one India was developing a special relationship with. This Russia tortures, kills, rapes and manipulates. This Russia is in strategic decline. I hope Indian leadership will stand on the right side of history.""Further, he said that the Russia-Ukraine war is also a war between the democratic world and an authoritarian once. Hence, he emphasised that it would be the ""most natural choice"" for India, as a big democratic country, to stand by democracy.Dmytro Kuleba also said that Russia is not as ""reliable"" a supplier of defence equipment to India as generally assumed.""Ukraine has effectively destroyed the most advanced Russian weapons on the battleground. So is it really in India's interest to buy weapons which don’t survive on the battleground?"" he asked.He said that India should choose its trade partners strategically as ""India is on the rise while Russia is in decline"".Speaking to India Today, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that Russia was conducting warfare in Ukraine in an inhuman and 'barbarian' way.""Russia will bear responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity on Ukrainian territory. Some towns and villages in Donbas don’t exist anymore because Russia razed them to the ground,"" he said.He added that Ukrainian authorities had discovered more than a thousand bodies of civilians, most of them shot, around capital Kyiv.""They didn’t die in bomb attacks. They were shot directly by Russian soldiers. Many had their hands tied behind their backs,"" he described.But even with the extent of brutality in the war, Dmytro Kuleba said he is convinced that Moscow will not use nuclear weapons.""Moscow understands that nuclear war will mean the end of Moscow. I don't know Putin's mind but if there are any remains of reason and wisdom, he will understand that resorting to nuclear weapons will mean the end of Russia,"" he said.He added, ""Russia is engaging in scare-mongering and blackmailing. Russia knows how to perfectly blackmail the world. The last thing we should do is to buy it.

6,7,Ajay Devgn says Hindi will always be our national language. Twitter fact-checks him,"Ajay Devgn found himself at the receiving end of social media anger after stating that Hindi “was, is, and will always be our national language” during a conversation with Kannada actor Kiccha Sudeep on Twitter on Wednesday. The 53-year-old actor was trolled as the internet fact-checked his statement soon after - there is no national language for India. Hindi, in fact, is India's most used language and is part of the 22 languages listed in the Indian Constitution's eighth schedule.It all started after Kiccha Sudeep said in an exclusive interview with Karnataka Tak recently that Hindi is not a national language anymore. While a certain section of the internet lashed out at the Kannada actor, Ajay Devgn, slightly late though, responded to Sudeep in a tweet in Hindi where he claimed the aforementioned.Ajay’s tweet, translated from Hindi to English, reads, ""Kiccha Sudeep, my brother, according to you, if Hindi is not our national language then why do you release your native language [mother tongue] films by dubbing them in Hindi? Hindi was, is and always will be our mother tongue and national language. Jan Gan Man."".@KicchaSudeep ,?,More on this story later because the internet, as unforgiving as it is, is busy lashing out at Ajay at the moment. With slight undertones of sarcasm, most users advised Ajay to do what his Twitter bio suggests: “I talk more in movies than in real life.” Others opted to help him with a GK lesson.Take a look at the tweets here:#AjayDevgn isliye bollywood ki koi baat serious nhi lete.India ki koi national langauge nhi h.isko bolo eight schedule padhe . ar India ki 5 classical language h Sanskrit ,Odia,Tamil,Telugu, Kannada. ye 5 sbse old sbse rich grammatical language @ajaydevgnFact is currently there is no national language of India.We only have official languages.Shall we have Hindi as one or not is something that could be debatable though #NationalLanguage #AjayDevgnThere is no national language in India.

9,10,It’s an honour to work with Dale Steyn: Umran Malik ,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) cricketer Umran Malik has thanked Dale Steyn for teaching him the tricks of the trade in the fast bowling department. The 22-year-old pacer has breathed fire in the 2022 Indian Premier League (IPL) as he has clocked in excess of 145 km/h on a pretty consistent basis.The Jammu and Kashmir pacer was a tad expensive to start his IPL 2022 sojourn, but has found his rhythm in the tournament. Malik said that he has enjoyed every moment of his interaction with Steyn, who joined the SRH team as the fast bowling coach back in December 2021.“I try to work plans for different batsmen, whether it's slower balls, yorkers or bouncers. Rest is upto God how the plans work or not. The advice (from Steyn) is to have plans and to execute them well. It's an honour to work with a legend like him,” Malik was quoted as saying.Malik, who joined the Sunrisers as a replacement bowler back in 2021, said that he interacts a lot with Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan and Marco Jansen to gain more knowledge about the art of pace bowling.“I talk a lot to Bhuvi Bhai (Bhuvneshwar), Nattu (Natarajan) and Jansen. They are all such great bowlers and they help on what to do, and not to do,” he stated.On Wednesday, April 27, the Sunrisers locked horns with the Gujarat Titans (GT) at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Hardik Pandya, the Titans’ skipper, is currently the leading run-scorer for his team in the tournament.Ahead of the match, Malik mentioned that he hasn’t formed any particular tactic for Pandya. “Gameplan is normal (for Hardik), just to keep things simple,” Malik added.Malik joined SRH after Natarajan was tested positive for COVID-19 in the previous edition of the IPL. Thereafter, he played a couple of games, after which the team retained him ahead of the 2022 mega auction along with skipper Kane Williamson and all-rounder Abdul Samad.",2022-04-27,"It’s an honour to work with Dale Steyn: Umran Malik Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) cricketer Umran Malik has thanked Dale Steyn for teaching him the tricks of the trade in the fast bowling department.

11,12,"Hands tied, face covered, highest level of pain: Ukrainians recount time spent in Russian custody | Exclusive","Baranick Valentin, 53, nonchalantly pulled down his pants to show the scar on his backside that he said was a bullet wound. The Ukrainian man said he was shot by the invading Russian forces in March.Like many others, he ended up in Russian custody when they had occupied Trostyanets, a town in Sumy province that shares a 500 km border with Russia. The town is about 35 km from the Russian border.Men like him were picked up by Russian forces on the suspicion of having inside information about the Ukrainian military. They were being called prisoners of war in their own country.How did Valentin end up in Russian custody? He said he was caught when he found a grenade outside his house and went to the riverside to dispose of it.""That's when they caught me. They tied my hands, covered my face, and the next morning, transferred me to the railway station from where Russian officers were working,"" he narrated.The railway station is in ruins. It had become the epicentre of a fierce battle as the Ukrainian military took on Russian forces who occupied the city for over 30 days.Now back at home to the great relief of his wife and daughter, Baranick Valentin recalled the horror of his time in Russian custody. ""I spent a week in custody at the railway station where I was tortured. It was a living hell. Happy I could come back alive,” he said. He was taken into custody on March 18 and released on March 24.During his time in custody, the Russian forces asked him for contacts of Ukrainian soldiers and their locations.Olexandr Sasha, 41, is another individual who was kept in Russian custody.He said, ""Russians entered my home and asked for my phone and passport. My phone was drained out of battery and didn't work so they took me away for verification. For ten days, from March 16 to 25, I was a prisoner. Most of the time, my hands were tied and face covered.”He told India Today’s reporter that he witnessed killings but did not want to talk about it.“I was tortured as the Russians kept asking the same questions that I had no answers to. They asked about Ukraine military, local government representatives, employees of local departments and location of soldiers.”Edward Pachkov, 33, said that his right hand was still injured after he faced ‘the highest level of pain’ while in Russian custody.""Russians stopped me and asked me to show documents. Within minutes, my hands were tied and I was stuffed in the trunk of a car. Next few days, I faced the highest level of pain. I don’t feel any sensation in my hand, it’s numb,” he said.In all, 22 civilians were picked up by Russian forces in Trostyanets town of Sumy region in Ukraine. There are several who are still missing and almost every day, bodies are found in the forest, officials said.The city of Trostyanets remains tense even though the Russian forces have retreated. After the Russian occupation, not much is left of the city.India Today visited homes, official buildings and the local hospital in the city all destroyed. Some other parts of Sumy region in northeast Ukraine are still being pounded by Russian missiles.The Russians have retreated from Trostyanets but for many, the nightmare isn’t over. Those who faced the worst of the occupation still live in anxiety with one question in their minds - what if the Russian forces come back?",2022-04-27,"Hands tied, face covered, highest level of pain: Ukrainians recount time spent in Russian custody | ExclusiveBaranick Valentin, 53, nonchalantly pulled down his pants to show the scar on his backside that he said was a bullet wound.

13,14,"Hands tied, face covered, highest level of pain: Ukrainians recount time spent in Russian custody | Exclusive","Baranick Valentin, 53, nonchalantly pulled down his pants to show the scar on his backside that he said was a bullet wound. The Ukrainian man said he was shot by the invading Russian forces in March.Like many others, he ended up in Russian custody when they had occupied Trostyanets, a town in Sumy province that shares a 500 km border with Russia. The town is about 35 km from the Russian border.Men like him were picked up by Russian forces on the suspicion of having inside information about the Ukrainian military. They were being called prisoners of war in their own country.How did Valentin end up in Russian custody? He said he was caught when he found a grenade outside his house and went to the riverside to dispose of it.""That's when they caught me. They tied my hands, covered my face, and the next morning, transferred me to the railway station from where Russian officers were working,"" he narrated.The railway station is in ruins. It had become the epicentre of a fierce battle as the Ukrainian military took on Russian forces who occupied the city for over 30 days.Now back at home to the great relief of his wife and daughter, Baranick Valentin recalled the horror of his time in Russian custody. ""I spent a week in custody at the railway station where I was tortured. It was a living hell. Happy I could come back alive,” he said. He was taken into custody on March 18 and released on March 24.During his time in custody, the Russian forces asked him for contacts of Ukrainian soldiers and their locations.Olexandr Sasha, 41, is another individual who was kept in Russian custody.He said, ""Russians entered my home and asked for my phone and passport. My phone was drained out of battery and didn't work so they took me away for verification. For ten days, from March 16 to 25, I was a prisoner. Most of the time, my hands were tied and face covered.”He told India Today’s reporter that he witnessed killings but did not want to talk about it.“I was tortured as the Russians kept asking the same questions that I had no answers to. They asked about Ukraine military, local government representatives, employees of local departments and location of soldiers.”Edward Pachkov, 33, said that his right hand was still injured after he faced ‘the highest level of pain’ while in Russian custody.""Russians stopped me and asked me to show documents. Within minutes, my hands were tied and I was stuffed in the trunk of a car. Next few days, I faced the highest level of pain. I don’t feel any sensation in my hand, it’s numb,” he said.In all, 22 civilians were picked up by Russian forces in Trostyanets town of Sumy region in Ukraine. There are several who are still missing and almost every day, bodies are found in the forest, officials said.The city of Trostyanets remains tense even though the Russian forces have retreated. After the Russian occupation, not much is left of the city.India Today visited homes, official buildings and the local hospital in the city all destroyed. Some other parts of Sumy region in northeast Ukraine are still being pounded by Russian missiles.The Russians have retreated from Trostyanets but for many, the nightmare isn’t over.

However, he played down any injury issue after coming back to lead Gujarat against Kolkata Knight Riders over the weekend, saying he took a break as a precautionary measure. Notably, Hardik had bowled only 2.3 overs against Rajasthan Royals after hitting a match-winning 87.Asked if he would bowl on Wednesday against SRH, Hardik said: ""I have to see.""""The kind of attack we are playing I can afford to take it easy. If need be, I will bowl, otherwise I will opt out.""Hardik has bowled 111 deliveries in IPL 2022 and has picked up 4 wickets at an impressive economy rate of less than 8 runs per over. Hardik had consistently clocked in excess of 135 kph but the all-rounder wants to be cautious as he gears up for a likely return to the senior national team after impressing in the new season.Hardik, as Gujarat head coach Ashish Nehra said before the tournament, has proved his mettle as a batter, hitting 295 runs in 6 matches, including 3 fifties.",need bowl hardik cagey bowling plan injury scarehardik pandya wednesday said going risk bowling gujarat titan unless need arises hinting use restrained approach injury scare ipl last week hardik said gujarat plenty bowling option necessary push hardik pandya began ipl season bowling full tilt new franchise star rounder headed new season captain gujarat titan without competitive action belt hardik taken lengthy break recover recurring back injury world cup uae ipl gt v srh live updateshardik bowled mumbai indian ipl bowled consistently india last year question asked place side baroda rounder came gun blazing contributing bat ball gujarat however hardik missed game chennai super king last week giving rise speculation injury concern however played injury issue coming back lead gujarat kolkata knight rider weekend saying took break precautionary measure notably hardik bowled over rajasthan royal hitting match winning asked would bowl wednesday srh hardik said see kind attack playing afford take easy need bowl otherwise opt hardik bowled delivery ipl picked wicket impressive economy rate le run per hardik consistently clocked excess kph rounder want cautious gear likely return senior national team impressing new season hardik gujarat head coach ashish nehra said tournament proved mettle batter hitting run match including fifty ,"[-0.15443827  0.12246015  0.05535119 -0.06521144  0.00801077 -0.27936852

15,16,Why Ajay Devgn's Tezz tezi se flopped. On Wahiyat Wednesday,"Ajay Devgn, Anil Kapoor, Priyadarshan - kaash naam ki kaafi hota! The trio was a part of a 2012 disaster titled Tezz, which was an exemplar of how perfect ingredients too can ruin a broth. Ajay Devgn is a Bollywood A-lister and serious roles come easily to him. Understood. But why Tezz? The film had a near-perfect star cast with a pinch of thrill and a dash of good songs - all punched for simmer by Priyadarshan. But Tezz went on to become a disaster in Ajay’s career. So much so, that jis Tezz-i se it hit the screens, usi Tezz-i se it dropped off too. How and why? Read all about it on Wahiyat Wednesday!Tezz is set in the backdrop of the UK, where almost every Indian wears dark-coloured glasses and oftentimes talk in a fake Hindi accent. For instance, take a moment to remember those friends who start pronouncing ‘cool’ as ‘kwel’ a week in America or London. Before we start, let us tell you that Tezz is the loose adaption of 1975 Japanese film, The Bullet Train that went wrong. The movie started with Zayed Khan (yeah, he’s there too but it hardly makes a difference), telling Ajay Devgn (Aakash Rana) how much he was missed. But the face he makes while trying to act! Zayed tries too hard in the first scene that will make you want to scream ‘Bas karo!’ Par ab bol ke kya faeda?Are you waiting for us to tell you about the plot? Let’s do it the other way round, just like the film. Aakash is an illegal immigrant married to a British citizen but is suddenly caught and ousted from the country. Zabardasti! Instead of applying for a VISA and fixing his misdeeds, Aakash feels that the muck he is in isn’t enough and requests the universe for more problems. And that is how vengeance comes to his mind. Wondering how? A bomb threat on a train! A plan is hatched and he knows all the steps to make his master plan a success but suddenly realises, ‘Arre, manpower toh bhool hi gaya!’ And that how Zayed (Aadil) and Sameera Reddy (Megha) get roped in. Never mind, they do a trashy job.Now Aakash’s plan is to threaten police officials (don’t miss the guts) and retrieve money in exchange for information on how to diffuse a bomb on the train. Years and years of police and bomb squad training for nothing!Yes, the only good thing about the film is Malayalam superstar Mohanlal apart from the mere presence of Ajay. What did we previously say about a dish going down the drain in spite of over-perfect ingredients? Yes, the same example applies here too. Mohanlal could have, and was, probably the only cherry on top after Ajay. The South star played a cop who saved passengers from the bombed-up train and had a gripping exit. But could someone offer him a better role, please?Slowly and very slowly, people keep dying one after the other and Aakash is one of the last people left behind. Later, some forced fight sequences and negotiations happen. In fact, it is only towards the end of the film that he gets to know he has a child and gives him a bear hug while the kid looks awkward. But there isn’t much time left for emotions and he has to die in the end (whoops). And some other useless plots later, Aakash dies. He leaves a will-turned-letter for his wife and even before we can gather our thoughts as to hua kya, Priyadarshan’s name flashes on the screen, denoting the film’s end and our wastage of time.Having said that, if you ever feel that you are wasting precious moments of your life, better watch Himmatwala than Tezz. That way you can at least have a laugh, unlike Tezz that leaves you feeling like you’re operating in a vacuum. As if life isn’t enough.",2022-04-27,"Why Ajay Devgn's Tezz tezi se flopped.

17,18,Don’t turn off engine at traffic signals: Bengaluru transport body tells bus drivers amid fire incidents,"The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has directed all its Ashok Leyland midi bus drivers not to switch off the engine at traffic signals. This order came after an initial investigation into the cases of buses catching fire, which revealed that the fires originated in the engine.Over the past three months, there have been three incidents where these BMTC buses caught fire. Even though no one was injured in all incidents, a separate committee was formed to investigate the matter.Anbhu Kumar, the Managing Director of BMTC, said, “We have advised the drivers not to switch off and restart the engine at every traffic signal to avoid an electrical shock circuit. Earlier, the engine was switched off to save diesel. Now, we have instructed the drivers to start the bus during the commencement of the trip in bus depots and to only turn it off at the end of the trip.”Addressing the findings of the initial investigation that revealed that the fires would start in the engine, he explained, “The electrical line and diesel line of these buses are next to each other. If there is a case of a diesel leakage, it will lead to a fire.”The order to not turn off engines has been made only as a temporary solution until the full investigation is completed. Ashok Leyland has also been asked to examine all their buses under BMTC.BMTC procured 186 buses from Ashok Leyland in 2014 that were termed as midi buses, being nine meters long and comprising 33 seats, used in the congested areas of the city.READ MORE| Govt ropes in IISc Bangalore to expand probe into electric scooter fire mishaps",2022-04-27,"Don’t turn off engine at traffic signals: Bengaluru transport body tells bus drivers amid fire incidentsThe Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has directed all its Ashok Leyland midi bus drivers not to switch off the engine at traffic signals.

25,26,Opposition-ruled states hit back at Centre after PM asks them to cut fuel tax,"In his first statement on rising fuel prices in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took aim at Opposition-ruled states during a meeting on Wednesday afternoon and asked them to reduce taxes.PM Modi said that states like Karnataka and Gujarat reduced Value Added Tax on fuel and passed on the benefits to people, despite the move hurting their treasuries. He added, ""However, states like Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Telangana, Maharashtra, Kerala and Jharkhand did not reduce tax on fuel, and should do it now.""""It has become imperative to increase the coordination between the Centre and the states and uphold the values of cooperative federalism,"" PM Modi said.The Opposition-ruled state governments have not taken very kindly to PM Modi's remarks during the Covid-19 review meet on Wednesday. They have accused him of lying to 'cover his failures', treating non-BJP states with a 'step-mother attitude' and attempting to deflect criticism targeted at the central government.Here is how different state governments have responded:KT Rama Rao, Telangana minister and working president of ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi, took to Twitter to allege that fuel prices had shot up because of the central government.He wrote, ""Name-calling states for not reducing VAT even though we never increased it - is this the co-operative federalism you're talking about Narendra Modi ji? Telangana hasn't increased VAT on fuel since 2014 and rounded off only once.""He added, ""We don't get 41 per cent of our rightful share because of the cess imposed by your government. In the form of cess, you are looting 11.4 per cent from the state and we are getting only 29.6 per cent for FY23. Please scrap cess so we can give petrol at Rs 70 and diesel at Rs 60 all over India. One Nation - One Price?""Fuel prices have shot up because of NPA Central govtName-calling states for not reducing VAT even though we never increased it; is this the co-operative federalism you're talking about @narendramodi ji?#Telangana hasn't increased VAT on fuel since 2014 & rounded off only onceWest Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has said that PM Modi's appeal to Opposition states to reduce fuel tax has a 'political agenda'. Further, she asked the Centre not to 'burden' state governments.She said, ""I ask you, Modi ji, not to talk about these things in a Covid meeting. He [Modi] is telling us to decrease the tax and he will loot the tax. The PM should not speak like this, he cannot burden states like this. He said states should reduce tax but he hiked the price! This is a one-sided remark which is totally misleading.""She said that the West Bengal government had been giving a subsidy of Re 1 on fuel for three years and lost Rs 1,500 crore as a result, but this was not mentioned by PM Modi.""We said share fuel revenue 50-50. But they [Centre] did not agree. They take away 75 per cent. The Centre has earned lakhs of crores on fuel but nothing is shared with the states. The Centre owed Rs 97,000 crore to Bengal - give me that money and we'll give subsidies. It is not true that we don't want to provide relief to the common man but Centre is imposing a huge burden on us,"" she said.Further, Mamata Banerjee alleged that the Centre favoured BJP-ruled states and gave 'step-mother' treatment to others. She said, ""Why should Opposition-ruled states face discrimination and step-mother attitude? This is also one type of extortion. Don't bulldoze democracy and federal structure. You [Modi] gave all the money to BJP-ruled states and not Opposition-ruled ones.""TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh added, ""To cover his failures, he [Modi] has lied and asked states to cut VAT.""A Saravanan, spokesperson of the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu, said that fuel prices are sky-high due to the Union government's cess.He said, ""Most important aspect is cess doesn't devolve to the state government. We make a counter-proposal to the prime minister. Please don't collect cess and make it VAT - at least the price that you take will devolve to the state governments.""Yet another aspect is the DMK has not raised these prices. We had reduced petrol prices by Rs 3. Also, the VAT prices were set by AIADMK. The PM instead of giving gyan should give VAT to the state. There is no accountability on cess. The Union government has earned Rs 26 lakh crore in last eight years - where has all this gone? The PM is trying to deflect the criticism against him,"" he added.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday that the state government cannot be held responsible for the spike in fuel prices.He said, “Today, in the price of one litre of diesel in Mumbai, Rs 24.38 is for the Centre and Rs 22.37 is for the state. In petrol price, 31.58 paise is central tax and 32.55 paise state tax. Therefore, it is not a fact that petrol and diesel have become more expensive due to the state.”Additionally, Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday that his government had already given citizens tax relief on natural gas.

33,34,Iga Swiatek pulls out of the Madrid Open citing shoulder injury,"Poland’s Iga Natalia Swiatek has pulled out of the Madrid Open due to an injury to her right shoulder. Earlier this month, the 20-year-old World No.1 defeated Belarusian star Aryna Sabalenka 6-2, 6-2 in the final of the Stuttgart Open. The Warsaw-born tennis player also defeated former World No.1 Naomi Osaka in straight sets in the final of the Miami Open in April.Swiatek clearly said that she doesn’t want to compromise on her fitness ahead of the upcoming edition of the French Open, starting May 22 at Roland Garros. The youngster reckoned that she needs some time off to get back in shape ahead of the clay court tournament next month.""Basically, it's not like we have some drama because everything is okay.

40,41,Does Congress have a Plan B after the Prashant Kishor fiasco?,"The Congress's failure to team up with poll strategist Prashant Kishor would go down as a case of missed opportunity or a ‘historic blunder.’What is more troubling for the grand old party is the absence of a ‘plan B’ to streamline the leadership issue and preparations for the 2024 general elections. There are nearly 12 state assembly polls lined up before 2024 including Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, where the party is in power.The internal disquiet in Rajasthan, the rise of the Aam Aadmi Party in states like Gujarat and uncertain fortunes in Karnataka, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh etc., make the Congress under the Gandhis far more vulnerable.There is also speculation over G 23 renewing their agitation or convening a workers' meeting to force the leadership issue.ALSO READ | Prashant Kishor, Congress walk their separate ways | RecapThe prospects of Rahul Gandhi returning as the 87th AICC chief for the 2022-27 term remain ambiguous. The Congress organisational polls are due in August 2022 but Rahul is yet to make up his mind. If he contests the Congress’ presidential polls, his victory [perhaps unanimous] would be a foregone conclusion, but electoral performance in Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana etc., may further erode his credibility within the Congress Parivar.If the Gandhis decide to prop up a non-Gandhi as leader of the Congress, the gesture would be seen as taking a leaf from Kishor’s recommendation. In fact, the public display of Kishor’s reported suggestions, prescriptions etc., has the potential to haunt Congress for a long time, as the party may get criticism for opting for his measures without giving credit.There is already a lot of speculation that talks with Kishor fell through because party bigwigs were opposed to giving him a free hand or a fancy designation or access to the party’s coffers [yes you read it right :) it is still something to be sought after!].ALSO READ | The PK-Congress deal: What went wrong | Inside storyIt is significant to note that, unlike a narrative perpetuated by a section of media, Kishor was not rejected by the grand old party on the grounds of the tactician’s ideology [rather the lack of it] or his professional dealings with the Indian Political Action Committee [I-PAC].Kishor was offered a place in the Congress and a membership in the high-profile ‘Empowered Action Group’ tasked to strategise for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. If there was any doubt about his integrity or association with I-PAC, the offer to join the Congress would not have been made in the first place.AICC general secretary and media department head Randeep Surjewala’s tweet bears testimony to it when he wrote, “Following a presentation & discussions with Sh. Prashant Kishor, Congress President, has constituted an Empowered Action Group 2024 & invited him to join the party as part of the group with defined responsibility.”The confrontation seems to be on his role and mandate where Kishor’s perception or expectations differed with the Congress high command. Kishor, in his presentation, had made a strong case for organisational revamp, settling of the leadership issue and the issue of forging alliances, the Congress focusing on 370 Lok Sabha seats etc.ALSO READ | Prashant Kishor declines Congress offer, won't join partyInterestingly, Kishor was approached by the Gandhis and not the party organisation. It is an open secret that the Gandhi trio Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka - carry enough political heft to push through anything they wish for. A classical case being Rahul’s 2019 election slogan, “chowkidar chor hai” which was not discussed or deliberated upon by any party fora.Post elections, Rahul had gone on record expressing his disappointment with party leaders’ failure to amplify the 'chowkidar Chor hai’ slogan.This was for the third time that the Congress and Kishor have tried establishing functional ties.In 2017, Kishor tried organising the Congress campaign in Uttar Pradesh. The outcome was disastrous.However, the Gandhis continued to talk to him. Throughout 2021, Kishor had a series of meetings with Sonia Gandhi where he harped on the theme of a major organisational overhaul, institutionalisation of ticket distribution system, poll alliances, fundraising etc.On his part, Kishor kept meeting a number of disgruntled party leaders known as G-23, AICC office bearers, regional satraps, and young guns directly. Sonia Gandhi then appointed a three-member committee comprising A K Antony, Mallikarjun Kharge, Ambika Soni to explore the possibility of his involvement with the Congress.A member of the panel had then told this columnist that a number of middle-rung and younger leaders had backed the move to draft Kishor but there were “muted voices” that the grand old party should not be seen as outsourcing its political activities to the new entrant.So, subject to Prashant Kishore getting a 'free hand,' PK focusing on 2024, leading the Congress charge, had been on ‘active consideration’ for over a year.On April 16, 2022, talks between Kishor and Sonia resumed. Just as it looked like the two sides were serious about forging a broad-based opposition alliance against BJP-NDA, some Congress leaders started expressing reservations on the grounds that a ‘free hand’, outsourcing political campaigns etc., may bring ‘bad optics.’Sonia Gandhi, having gone a bit too far, fell upon her favourite penchant -- committee raj. Acting on the advice of A K Antony, Digvijaya Singh and others, she proposed a 17-member empowered Action Group with Kishor as a member with a condition that he should formally join the party.In Kishor’s scheme of things, perhaps it was a case of too little. The tactician, having worked with many politicians, possibly viewed direct access to the top leadership as more functional than hierarchical or as a status symbol.

42,43,Vivek Agnihotri's The Kashmir Files to release in Israel on April 28,"The Kashmir Files, which released in the theatres in India on March 11, got a thunderous response. Based on the exodus of Kashmiri Hindus during the Kashmir insurgency in 1990, the film is now set to release in Israel. Directed by Vivek Agnihotrr, The Kashmir Files stars Anupam Kher, Darshan Kumaar, Mithun Chakraborty and Pallavi Joshi.Ever since its release, The Kashmir Files has created a huge noise among the audience and broken several records at the box office. Now, the Vivek Agnihotri directorial venture is all set to hit cinemas in Israel on April 28.Speaking about the film, the lead actor Anupam Kher in a promotional video said “Shalom and Namaste to my friends in Israel. As you know, our film The Kashmir Files is releasing in your country. It’s a very important film of our time. It’s about the genocide of Kashmiri Hindus from Kashmir in 1990. And the world has given its love to the film and has helped us to heal to some extent. And now in Israel as the film was released, I request you to watch the film in the theatre and give it all the love.

43,44,SC asks Centre why Rajiv Gandhi assassination convict can't be released ,"Supreme Court on Wednesday sought reasons from Centre for not releasing Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convict AG Perarivalan from jail despite him serving a sentence of 36 years.A bench of Justices LN Rao and BR Gavai asked the Additional Solicitor General KM Natraj: “Why don’t you just agree to have him released? People who have served over 20 years are released. We are also offering you an escape route.

44,45,What is H3N8 bird flu whose first human case was reported in China?,"While the world witnessed another surge in the Covid-19 cases, a new development from China is set to raise alert levels across the world. China's central province of Henan has reported the first human infection of the H3N8 strain of bird flu.While the risk of its spread among people is being pegged low, according to Chinese authorities, the H3N8 is common in horses and dogs and has even been found in seals. No human cases have so far been found anywhere else in the world. China's National Health Commission has said that the variant was found in a four-year-old boy who showed fever and other symptoms.H3N8 is a type of canine influenza, which is also known as dog flu. According to the US-based Centre for Disease Prevention & Control (CDC), canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses are different from seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses that spread annually in people.H3N8 viruses originated in horses and then transmitted to dogs. ""H3N8 equine influenza (horse flu) viruses have been known to exist in horses for more than 40 years,"" CDC maintains. Scientists have said that the virus jumped from horses to dogs for survival and has adapted to cause illness in dogs and spread among dogs, especially those housed in kennels and shelters.Meanwhile, the Canine influenza H3N2 virus originated in birds, is transmitted to dogs, and can now spread between dogs.The first cases of canine influenza from H3N8 were reported in 2004 as it emerged in greyhounds in the United States.So far, there have been no other reports of the virus jumping on to humans from animals. The report from China is the first case of such an event. According to Reuters, the child had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home. Whole-genome sequence analyses indicate that the H3N8 virus in this human case is a reassortant, with genes from viruses that have been detected previously in poultry and wild birds.The health commission has said an initial study showed the variant did not yet have the ability to effectively infect humans, and the risk of a large-scale epidemic was low.",2022-04-27,"What is H3N8 bird flu whose first human case was reported in China?While the world witnessed another surge in the Covid-19 cases, a new development from China is set to raise alert levels across the world.

Now, Ajay Devgn hit back at Kiccha Sudeep on Twitter in Hindi. Its English translation roughly reads: ""Kiccha Sudeep, my brother, according to you, if Hindi is not our national language then why do you release your native language [mother tongue] films by dubbing them in Hindi? Hindi was, is and always will be our mother tongue and national language. Jan Gan Man.""Here is the tweet:.@KicchaSudeep ,?,Kiccha Sudeep has now replied to Ajay Devgn's tweet.

49,50,OPINION | Startup Challenges: Is it the VC who should be hung?,"In the last few months, we have seen startups being embroiled in corporate governance issues, typically involving their founders. We have seen promising startups such as BharatPe, Zilingo, Infra.market, Trell etc. running into problems of corporate governance. This comes in the backdrop of India having blazed from being almost nowhere in the global startup pecking order about seven years ago to becoming the 3rd largest ecosystem for start-ups in the world, right behind US and China. India now has over 61,400 start-ups, with over 95 of them having achieved 'unicorn' status. That is, they have a valuation of over USD 1 billion.This is stupendous growth for any economy, and it has been possible to a large extent because of the venture capitalists or VC's providing unflinching financial backing to these hordes of startups. Unlike banks or traditional providers of capital for an enterprise, Venture Capitalists (VC's) do not take any collateral and bet their money on the founding team and their idea. It involves a lot of risks and, hopefully, a very significant return that justifies the risk. So in the success of the startups, lies the success of the VC's.ALSO READ | It’s time to regulate regulations in India to boost startups | OPINIONTo understand the issue, one has to understand the business of a Venture Capitalist. Being a VC is expensive. A typical VC firm would require a certain number of people to be on their team in order to sift through the various investment opportunities, do the due diligence and eventually make the investment, adhering to a host of local regulations and ensuring that the investee companies sign on to adhere to the law of the land and to uphold the interests of the investors. In order to support such a large internal team and to keep its overall risks low, a VC typically breaks its total investments into a large number of smaller investments and invests in multiple startups. This also means that the VC's would be extremely challenged in providing oversight to each company, as the companies themselves go through break-neck growth, fuelled by the idea, the entrepreneurial spirit, the market and the backing of the VC capital.ALSO READ | The gaming of warfare | OPINIONIn such a context, is it really fair to zero-in on the VC's for breaches in corporate governance of these fast-growing startups? If the leadership of the startups do not bring up the issues to the board, or the auditors are not able to catch a break in the pattern in the accounts as the startups are new and do not really have much of a history to detect a pattern and are by definition, creating a new sub-industry that does not have precedences to fall back upon, is it realistically feasible for VC's, whose core expertise is to fund startups and not to run startups, to be able to catch slippages in corporate governance? It does seem to be a herculean task.If we look at this issue from the context of traditional corporates, is it justified to hold banks responsible for the failure of large corporates such as Enron or Arthur Andersen or Satyam etc? The job of the banks is to fund the corporates. They sometimes also get a board seat which helps them ensure that their investments are safe. But does it mean that the banks are solely responsible for the failure of these corporate bodies? Clearly no. There are many other factors that lead to slippages in corporate governance staying undetected, and having a board seat does not ensure that one is able to detect such slippages.Indian corporates as a whole seem to be having a large number of cases of inappropriate corporate governance. This is probably the right time to bring in fundamental changes in the oversight of companies and to strengthen them in order to propel India into the top three economies by the end of this decade. However, it would be unwise to shoot the funder, the banker or the VC who helps in providing the fuel to the entrepreneurial energies of this country, for issues that they may not be responsible for.",2022-04-27,"OPINION | Startup Challenges: Is it the VC who should be hung?In the last few months, we have seen startups being embroiled in corporate governance issues, typically involving their founders.

Prior to the 2022 Australian Open, Osaka was ranked 14, but she dropped 71 spots after her third-round loss to America’s Amanda Anisimova 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (5).While being in Miami, Osaka talked about consulting a therapist to take care of her mental health. She said that her therapist formulated some strategies for her to apply during challenging circumstances.""Yeah, so -- hmm. I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but I finally started talking to a therapist after Indian Wells. It only took like a year after the French Open,” she said.Back in January 2019, Osaka became the World No.1 for the first time in her career. After going down in the rankings, the Japanese star is looking forward to climbing the ladder and has set her goals clear for 2022.""I think by next year or by the end of this year, I would love to be in the Top 10,"" Osaka added. Currently ranked 36, Osaka has won the Australian Open and US Open two times each.",lot people praying downfall osaka thanks fan backing amidst mental struggle japanese tennis prodigy naomi osaka thanked fan immense support shown challenge last month back september year old decided take break sport shock defeat u open final hand canadian year old leylah fernandez last year may osaka withdrew french open fined warned attending press conference youngster also said number people want scale height career osaka took twitter wrote lol want say fw thank tbh probably lot people praying downfall really feel cause love overpowers everything thank lol want say fw thank tbh probably lot people praying downfall really feel cause love overpowers everything thank youearlier month osaka finished runner miami open losing poland iga natalia swiatek back january osaka dropped wta single world ranking prior australian open osaka ranked dropped spot third round loss america amanda anisimova miami osaka talked consulting therapist take care mental health said therapist formulated strategy apply challenging circumstance yeah hmm know allowed say finally started talking therapist indian well took like year french open said back january osaka became world first time career going ranking japanese star looking forward climbing ladder set goal clear think next year end year would love top osaka added currently ranked osaka australian open u open two time ,"[-0.17902898  0.14107342  0.06392456 -0.07645451  0.00735242 -0.32543773

63,64,‘State govt can’t be blamed for spike in fuel price’: Maha CM responds to PM Modi,"After PM Modi appealed to states ruled by non-BJP parties to reduce tax on fuel at a meeting on Wednesday afternoon, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray hit back and said that the state government cannot be held responsible for the spike in fuel prices.He said, “Today, in the price of one litre of diesel in Mumbai, Rs 24.38 is for the Centre and Rs 22.37 is for the state. In petrol price, 31.58 paise is central tax and 32.55 paise state tax. Therefore, it is not a fact that petrol and diesel have become more expensive due to the state.”The Office of the Chief Minister added, “Maharashtra collects the highest GST of 15 per cent in the country. Combining both direct taxes and GST, Maharashtra is the number one state in the country.”In his concluding remarks at a meeting with chief ministers to review the Covid-19 situation in India, PM Modi focused on the issue of rise in fuel price.He said prices were higher in many opposition-ruled states and urged them to reduce Value Added Tax in ""national interest"" to benefit the common man.“I am not criticising anyone but am praying to you for the welfare of people of your states...I urge you to reduce VAT now even after a delay of six months to benefit people,"" he said.As per sources, reduction of VAT on fuel may be discussed at a Maharashtra cabinet meeting on Thursday.Additionally, Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday that his government had already given citizens tax relief on natural gas.In order to promote the use of natural gas, the rate of value added tax has been reduced from 13.5 per cent to 3 per cent, he said. He added that piped gas holders and public transport had benefited.“Under various tax laws, the amount of arrears up to Rs 10,000 per year has been waived off. Benefit has been given to nearly 1 lakh small traders. Traders who have arrears of Rs 10 lakh have been given the option to pay 20 per cent of the total arrears. This will benefit the middle traders in more than two lakh cases,” he said.The Maharashtra CM also said that the facility to pay arrears in installments or one time in case of arrears of Rs 50 lakh has been given.“0.1 per cent stamp duty on gold and silver imported in the state has been waived. Exemption from tax for three years to passengers, pets, vehicles, goods, etc. traveling on ferry boats, ro-ro boats on the waterways starting from January 1, 2022 within the limits of the Maritime Board has been given to promote shipping in the state,” he added.Uddhav Thackeray also accused the Centre of giving 'step-motherly treatment' to the state and not treating all states equally.Maharashtra's Leader of Opposition and BJP member Devendra Fadnavis took to Twitter to respond to Uddhav Thackeray's statements.He said, ""Blame game is safe and good for hiding misdeeds but it doesn’t give relief to the common man.

64,65,Karachi bombing: Why there is huge Baloch pushback against China-Pak corridor,"A burqa-clad Baloch woman suicide bomber killed four people, including three Chinese nationals (tutors), in an attack on a minibus carrying staff from China-built Confucius Institute at Karachi University on Tuesday.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) has claimed responsibility for the attack, the first major one this year against nationals of all-weather ally China working in Pakistan. BLA, banned in Pakistan for ""terror activities"", said it was their first suicide attack by a woman assailant.While the Karachi suicide bombing is part of an intensifying Baloch pushback against the $54 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), it also spotlights the larger and deeper struggle for Balochistan’s freedom.Let’s first understand Balochistan. Rich in natural resources, it’s Pakistan’s largest but also poorest province, with Quetta as its capital.

On the other hand, it's China that’s emerged as a crucial player in Balochistan.China had long been interested in Balochistan’s copper, gold, gas and coal deposits.

CPEC has also drawn India's objection.India has repeatedly objected to CPEC passing through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and asked both Pakistan and China not to alter the status quo in areas illegally occupied by Pakistan.

However, China continues to be involved in its expansionist designs in Balochistan.”“Targeting director and officials of the Confucius Institute, the symbol of Chinese economic, cultural and political expansionism, was to give a clear message to China that its direct or indirect presence in Balochistan will not be tolerated,” BLA has said.The Confucius Institutes are a significant Chinese push for soft power across countries but have often been branded as China’s propaganda mission, also around how Pakistan treats Balochistan.The massive Baloch pushback against the CPEC is part of the larger struggle for Balochistan’s freedom, BLA has said.BLA has said that it had warned China several times to “refrain from aiding Pakistan militarily and financially in carrying out Baloch genocide, but to no avail.”BLA has said Shari was a member of the Baloch Students’ Organisation and was aware of Baloch genocide and occupation of Balochistan.After Tuesday’s attack, Pakistani authorities scrambled to appease China. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has mourned the death of “Chinese friends”, “strongly condemned the heinous and cowardly act of terrorism” and promised action against “the perpetrators.”Pakistan's foreign ministry called the suicide blast ""a direct attack on Pakistan-China friendship"". China has said the blood of the Chinese cannot be shed in vain, demanded severe punishment for the attackers and asked Pakistan to do everything possible to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects in Pakistan.On the other hand, BLA has threatened bigger attacks on Chinese nationals and China’s interests in Balochistan and elsewhere in Pakistan.BLA has asked China to immediately halt its “exploitation projects” and refrain from aiding “the occupying Pakistani state” as “hundreds of highly trained BLA members are ready to carry out deadly attacks.” BLA also asked Pakistan to withdraw from Balochistan, “recognising its independence”.So what comes next? Tuesday’s attack is a crucial challenge for the new Pakistan government, installed after weeks of political turmoil that saw Imran Khan’s ouster as Pakistan’s prime minister, at a time when the Pakistan-Afghanistan border is already on fire.Given the confrontational posturing of Pakistan, China and BLA, the coming days may see more blood in Balochistan and beyond. Pakistan can no longer regard the Baloch insurgency as a low-intensity conflict.",2022-04-27,"Karachi bombing: Why there is huge Baloch pushback against China-Pak corridorA burqa-clad Baloch woman suicide bomber killed four people, including three Chinese nationals (tutors), in an attack on a minibus carrying staff from China-built Confucius Institute at Karachi University on Tuesday.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) has claimed responsibility for the attack, the first major one this year against nationals of all-weather ally China working in Pakistan. BLA, banned in Pakistan for ""terror activities"", said it was their first suicide attack by a woman assailant.While the Karachi suicide bombing is part of an intensifying Baloch pushback against the $54 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), it also spotlights the larger and deeper struggle for Balochistan’s freedom.Let’s first understand Balochistan. Rich in natural resources, it’s Pakistan’s largest but also poorest province, with Quetta as its capital.

68,69,Palm oil export ban by Indonesia begins tomorrow | All you need to know,"Indonesia, the world's top palm oil producer, will ban exports of refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) palm olein, which are made by crushing palm fruit and processing it to remove impurities. The ban is set to begin on Thursday.President Joko Widodo announced the ban on Friday to help lower soaring domestic prices.Palm oil is used in everything from cakes, chocolate, margarine and frying fats to cosmetics, soap, shampoo and cleaning products.Small palm oil planters in Indonesia have enjoyed big paycheques in the past year as global vegetable oil prices surged, but these farmers fear they will bear the brunt of the pain from a new export ban coming into effect on Thursday.Local farmers said prices of fresh palm fruit bunches have already plunged in Kampar, Riau Province on Sumatra island, Reuters reported.Indonesia's ban on palm oil exports is unlikely to last more than a month as Jakarta has limited infrastructure to store the surplus oil and the country faces mounting pressure from buyers to resume shipments, industry officials in Indonesia were quoted as saying by Reuters.The shock move has lifted prices of all edible oils and sowed confusion and alarm among palm oil exporters and consumers alike.However, the stock market panic subsided after officials told palm oil executives the ban will only apply to exports of refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) palm olein, and would not affect flows of crude palm oil or other forms of derivative products.However, Jakarta will widen the ban ""if there is a shortage of refined palm oil,"" according to a presentation the government gave to companies on Monday. RBD palm olein accounts for around 40% of Indonesia's total exports of palm oil products, according to analysts' estimates.Indonesia meets nearly 50 per cent of the total palm oil requirement in India annually.India consumes 22.5 million tonne of edible oil annually, of which 9-9.5 million tonne is met by domestic supplies and the rest by imports. About 3.5-4 million tonne of palm oil is imported by India annually from Indonesia, as per a PTI report.ALSO READ | Palm oil price to go up?

76,77,"Pune Police books father, husband of pregnant minor; invokes anti-child marriage law","A 17-year-old girl was found three months pregnant in Maharashtra's Pune district, prompting the police to file a rape case and invoke anti-child marriage legislation. Police received information about the girl being pregnant from a state-run hospital in Pimpri Chinchwad on Monday, following which the girl's 19-year-old husband and father were booked in this regard.Chakan police filed a First Information Report (FIR) report after hospital authorities informed them that they were treating a 17-year-old married girl who is three months pregnant. Police launched a preliminary probe but no arrests have been made so far.Police officials told the Indian Express, ""The family of the girl and her 19-year-old husband hail from the same village in Khed taluka in Pune and the two got married in July last year. The girl was 16 at that time.Police have invoked Indian Penal Code section 376 (Rape) and provision of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006.

83,84,Mamata will be game-changer in 2024 Lok Sabha polls: TMC's Shatrughan Sinha | Exclusive,"In an exclusive conversation with India Today, newly elected MP Shatrughan Sinha said that West Bengal CM and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee is likely to be the “real game-changer” in the 2024 Lok Sabha election.Shatrughan Sinha, who won the Asansol Lok Sabha constituency in the bypoll held earlier this month, said, “I am impressed by the queen of hearts Mamata Banerjee. She is a tried and tested leader who is respected by all. We shall try our best to see that she becomes the real game-changer in the 2024 election.”Earlier in April, actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha beat BJP’s Agnimitra Paul by more than 3 lakh votes to win in Asansol, a constituency in West Bengal that the TMC has never won before.Speaking on his journey in politics, Shatrughan Sinha told India Today, “I came into politics to fulfil my social obligation. I was influenced by Jayprakash Narayan.”Further, he said he left the BJP and joined the All India Trinamool Congress because the saffron party had transformed into an autocracy from a democracy.“Atal Bihari's and LK Advani's BJP was a democratic setup. Today's BJP, which is being run by the prime minister, is an autocracy,” said Shatrughan Sinha, who was a minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's cabinet.He added that he had fought his first election because his then mentor LK Advani had told him to.Narrating the story, he said, “I fought my first election against my friend Rajesh Khanna, who was fighting on a Congress ticket, and lost. It was a by-election. I didn't want to fight it but did because my mentor Advani told me to do so. Advani spoke to my wife and asked her to tell me to fight the election.”",2022-04-27,"Mamata will be game-changer in 2024 Lok Sabha polls: TMC's Shatrughan Sinha | ExclusiveIn an exclusive conversation with India Today, newly elected MP Shatrughan Sinha said that West Bengal CM and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee is likely to be the “real game-changer” in the 2024 Lok Sabha election.Shatrughan Sinha, who won the Asansol Lok Sabha constituency in the bypoll held earlier this month, said, “I am impressed by the queen of hearts Mamata Banerjee.

I was influenced by Jayprakash Narayan.”Further, he said he left the BJP and joined the All India Trinamool Congress because the saffron party had transformed into an autocracy from a democracy.“Atal Bihari's and LK Advani's BJP was a democratic setup. Today's BJP, which is being run by the prime minister, is an autocracy,” said Shatrughan Sinha, who was a minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's cabinet.He added that he had fought his first election because his then mentor LK Advani had told him to.Narrating the story, he said, “I fought my first election against my friend Rajesh Khanna, who was fighting on a Congress ticket, and lost. It was a by-election. I didn't want to fight it but did because my mentor Advani told me to do so. Advani spoke to my wife and asked her to tell me to fight the election.”",mamata game changer lok sabha poll tmc shatrughan sinha exclusivein exclusive conversation india today newly elected mp shatrughan sinha said west bengal cm tmc supremo mamata banerjee likely real game changer lok sabha election shatrughan sinha asansol lok sabha constituency bypoll held earlier month said impressed queen heart mamata banerjee tried tested leader respected shall try best see becomes real game changer election earlier april actor turned politician shatrughan sinha beat bjp agnimitra paul lakh vote win asansol constituency west bengal tmc never speaking journey politics shatrughan sinha told india today came politics fulfil social obligation influenced jayprakash narayan said left bjp joined india trinamool congress saffron party transformed autocracy democracy atal bihari lk advani bjp democratic setup today bjp run prime minister autocracy said shatrughan sinha minister atal bihari vajpayee cabinet added fought first election mentor lk advani told narrating story said fought first election friend rajesh khanna fighting congress ticket lost election want fight mentor advani told advani spoke wife asked tell fight election ,"[-1.57081368e-01  1.22941512e-01  5.44971291e-02 -6.72341535e-02

84,85,Broke 3-4 remote controls at hotel room: Ponting on 'frustrating' isolation,"Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting said he is relieved and excited again to be back after completing the 5-day isolation as the team heads into the second half of Indian Premier League 2022. Ponting was forced to miss the match against Delhi Capitals on Friday, April 22 after one of his family members tested positive for Covid-19.Delhi Capitals confirmed that Ricky Ponting tested negative for Covid-19 but he was isolated as a precautionary measure.Recalling the time away from the game, Ponting said it was a frustrating experience, not being able to be on the sidelines and shout instructions to the team when they lost a last-over thriller to the Rajasthan Royals. The Australian tactician said he broke a couple of television remotes at the hotel room, venting out his frustration.""It's nice to be back outside again. Frustrating (not to travel with the team). I broke 3-4 remote controls.3 or 4 bottles of water might have got thrown into the wall,"" Ponting told Delhi Capitals.""When you are on the sidelines being a coach and you can't control what's happening in the middle, that's hard enough. When you are not on the sidelines, and sending text messages every over, saying 'do this, do that, do this'. It got a little more frustrating,"" he added.Delhi Capitals began their campaign well by beating Mumbai Indians but they have lacked the consistency that vaulted them to the play-offs in the last 2 seasons. Delhi have not managed to stich two successive victories even once in the season.Ponting said he thought Delhi would gather a winning run after their dominant 9-wicket win over Punjab Kings on April 20 but they lost to Rajasthan Royals by 15 runs in a high-scorig match.With Ponting not at the dug-out, tempers flared as Rishabh Pant got assistant coach Pravin Amre to storm onto the pitch and contest the on-field umpire's call over waist-high fulltoss during a tense final over.""I've said it a few times this year where there's 36 or 37 overs of really good stuff, and we just let it slip for two or three overs. And, that's the difference in these games,"" Ponting added.""We sort of gear ourselves to not overtrain in the first part of the season, try and build up along the way. But our performances have been win one, lose one, win one. So, we need to start getting that little bit of momentum.""""Our performances have been win one, lose win. After our win against the Kings, I thought the momentum would have been going our away. It didn't happen in the last game. We are so close to turnin it around.""We've all got to trust, we've got to believe, we've got to stay upbeat and positive.

90,91,"Punjab: BKU Ugrahan protests against power crisis, slogans against state govt raised","Amid the heatwave, Punjab has been witnessing frequent long powercuts owing to the outage of two more power-generating units. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Ugrahan, Punjab's largest farmers' body, protested against the state government and electricity department as the people of Punjab are bearing the brunt due to unscheduled power cuts.However, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL), claims that there is no shortage and power cuts have been imposed to avoid fire incidents. The protestors claimed that several villages in Mansa district of Punjab are facing issues due to the non-availability of power supply in homes and tractors in the field, causing inconvenience to the farmers.Expressing strong resentment against the PSPCL and the state government, members of the BKU Union staged a protest outside the Joga electricity department and raised slogans.The protesting farmers said, ""Farmers have been told to focus on the production of additional crops apart from the customary ones. But due to the non-availability of electricity at homes and in field tractors, it is difficult for us to grow corn and other crops. The government should focus on the relevant problems as we are fed up with the acute water crisis. The government should make sure that there is an uninterrupted supply of electricity and if our demands are not fulfilled, then we will block the streets and protest strongly against the government.""ALSO READ| Punjab polls: BKU Ugrahan refuses to extend support to SSMFor the unversed, Punjab has slipped into an acute electricity crisis due to outages at Talwandi Sabo and Ropar thermal plants. The PSPCL is resorting to unscheduled power cuts, particularly in rural areas.In another worrying news, the state is also running out of coal as none of the five thermal plants have enough stocks as per provisions of the power purchase agreements.

The protestors claimed that several villages in Mansa district of Punjab are facing issues due to the non-availability of power supply in homes and tractors in the field, causing inconvenience to the farmers.Expressing strong resentment against the PSPCL and the state government, members of the BKU Union staged a protest outside the Joga electricity department and raised slogans.The protesting farmers said, ""Farmers have been told to focus on the production of additional crops apart from the customary ones. But due to the non-availability of electricity at homes and in field tractors, it is difficult for us to grow corn and other crops. The government should focus on the relevant problems as we are fed up with the acute water crisis. The government should make sure that there is an uninterrupted supply of electricity and if our demands are not fulfilled, then we will block the streets and protest strongly against the government.""ALSO READ| Punjab polls: BKU Ugrahan refuses to extend support to SSMFor the unversed, Punjab has slipped into an acute electricity crisis due to outages at Talwandi Sabo and Ropar thermal plants.

100,101,"Blood of Chinese cannot be shed in vain, perpetrators should be punished: China after 3 killed in Pak blast","China on Wednesday asked Pakistan to scale-up security for its nationals working in the country and demanded a thorough investigation and punishment to the perpetrators behind the suicide attack at the Karachi University which killed three Chinese teachers and injured another.The blood of the Chinese cannot be shed in vain, and those behind this incident will surely pay the price, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said while strongly condemning the latest attack on Chinese nationals working in Pakistan.An explosion triggered by a burqa-clad Baloch woman suicide bomber ripped through a shuttle passenger van of the Confucius Institute at the prestigious University of Karachi on Tuesday, leaving three Chinese teachers dead and one injured and causing several Pakistani casualties, in the latest targeted attack against Chinese citizens in Pakistan’s financial capital.ALSO READ | 3 Chinese nationals killed as mother of two blows up van outside Karachi UniversityChina expressed its “strong condemnation and great indignation” at the attack, as well as deep condolences to the victims and sincere sympathy to the injured and the bereaved families, the state-run Xinhua news agency quoted the spokesperson as saying.Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Jianghao has made an urgent phone call to the Pakistani Ambassador to China to express extremely grave concern, the report said.Wu demanded that the Pakistani side should immediately conduct a thorough investigation into the incident, apprehend and punish the perpetrators to the full extent of the law, and take all possible measures to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens in Pakistan and prevent such incidents from happening again, the spokesperson said.The Chinese Foreign Ministry and Chinese diplomatic missions in Pakistan will continue to urge relevant Pakistani departments to handle properly the follow-up matters of those killed, treat the injured, and resolutely crack down on the terrorist organisation involved, the spokesperson said.ALSO READ | A mother of 2 and wife of a doctor, Karachi suicide bomber held a master's degreeThe banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) linked Majeed Brigade has claimed responsibility for the attack that took place near China-built Confucius Institute — a non-profit institute teaching Chinese language to local pupils — in Karachi University.A spokesperson for the university said that three of the victims were Chinese nationals. They were identified as Confucius Institute Director Huang Guiping, Ding Mupeng, Chen Sa and Khalid, the Pakistani driver.The spokesperson added that two others — Chinese national Wang Yuqing and a Pakistani man Hamid — were injured in the blast.CCTV footage of the attack showed a burqa-clad woman standing outside the entrance of the Confucius Institute. The woman detonated herself just as the van neared the institute’s entrance.A spokesperson of the BLA, the separatist outfit which is banned in Pakistan, the UK and the US, said that the attack was carried out by Shari Baloch alias Bramsh the “first female suicide bomber of the brigade”.

Crew-4 astronauts will do it in spaceSpaceX on Wednesday launched four astronauts to the Space Station on a mission to conduct science experiments as humans push towards the Moon and plan to journey to Mars in the coming decades. Nasa astronauts Kjell Lindgren, Robert Hines, and Jessica Watkins along with European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti will dock with the flying outpost on Thursday.As part of the mission, the four astronauts will conduct several experiments on the flying laboratory, including an attempt to grow plants without soil. The team will continue the work by the Crew-3 mission, which will hand over the experiment already underway to the new team.After docking with the Space Station on Thursday, the four-member crew will engage in a series of scientific experiments that include hydroponic (liquid-based) and aeroponic (air-based) techniques to grow plants without soil. Dubbed XROOTS, the team will use video and still images to evaluate plant growth throughout the entire life cycle.""Current space-based plant systems are small and use particulate media-based systems to deliver water and nutrients. These do not scale up well in space due to mass, containment, maintenance, and sanitation issues. Hydroponic and aeroponic techniques could enable the production of crops on a larger scale for future space exploration,"" Nasa said in a statement.Crew-4 will also be involved with the Protein-Based Artificial Retina Manufacturing experiment that aims at evaluating a manufacturing process to develop artificial human retinas using a light-activated protein called bacteriorhodopsin, which could replace the function of damaged light-sensing cells in the eye. If tested successfully, this could lead to millions on Earth getting vision using AI.The astronauts will also be working on Kibo Robot Programming Challenge that allows students to create programs to control Astrobee, a free-flying robot aboard the International Space Station. To test the technology, students have written software to use multiple free-flying satellites to construct 3D models of a target object. ""The ability to create such models of unknown objects in space using one or two small satellites has potential applications for a wide range of space missions,"" Nasa has said.Medical studies have been one of the biggest focuses for astronauts in space as they bid to ensure a healthy lifestyle for crews that will take to Moon and Mars in the future. The Crew-4 will continue the tradition as they demonstrate tests using a modified, commercial off-the-shelf device to diagnose certain medical conditions. The experiment named rHEALTH uses flow cytometry, a method using lasers to sort and identify cells, and can analyze cell count and cell characteristics; detect microorganisms, biomarkers, and proteins; and diagnose health disorders such as blood cancers.The experiments on board the flying outpost are set to enhance human understanding and not just create the technology for tomorrow but aid humans on Earth as well.",2022-04-27,"Can you grow plants without soil?

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and health officials from different primary health centres (PHCs) have been given the responsibility to contact the eligible individuals and request them to take the vaccine.The civic body has been conducting door-to-door surveys to convince people to take the Covid-19 vaccine and contact tracing has been intensified.Special Health Commissioner, health, BBMP, Dr KV Trilok Chandra said that health officials are now going to the homes of people who have not taken the second dose of the vaccine and are convincing them to administer the jab.“There still seems to be some resistance. We are convincing them to take the second dose. We are also following up on those who are eligible to take the precautionary dose,” he was quoted by the Hindu as saying.According to him, in the past two months, health workers serving with the BBMP along with the mobile vaccination units reached out to eight lakh people and they were given the second dose. With the Covid-19 cases rising in a few states, the BBMP too is likely to increase targeted testing.""Though cases are increasing, the number of people getting admitted to hospital is low. To ensure cases don’t rise, more attention is being paid to getting people vaccinated,"" he told the media on Tuesday.In a bid to ramp up Covid-19 testing, the BBMP has roped in more doctors, swab collectors and data entry operators.

The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and health officials from different primary health centres (PHCs) have been given the responsibility to contact the eligible individuals and request them to take the vaccine.The civic body has been conducting door-to-door surveys to convince people to take the Covid-19 vaccine and contact tracing has been intensified.Special Health Commissioner, health, BBMP, Dr KV Trilok Chandra said that health officials are now going to the homes of people who have not taken the second dose of the vaccine and are convincing them to administer the jab.“There still seems to be some resistance.

To ensure cases don’t rise, more attention is being paid to getting people vaccinated,"" he told the media on Tuesday.In a bid to ramp up Covid-19 testing, the BBMP has roped in more doctors, swab collectors and data entry operators.

111,112,Why did Ajay Devgn hop onto the director's seat with Runway 34 after Shivaay? Actor explains,"Just two days left for the release of Runway 34, and director-actor Ajay Devgn is anxious for his dream project to hit the screens. Runway 34 is a thriller, which stars Ajay, Amitabh Bachchan, Rakul Preet Singh, Boman Irani, Angira Dhar, Aakanksha Singh. For the unaware, the film has been directed by Ajay himself. During an interview with IndiaToday.in, the superstar shared the reason for hopping onto the director's seat after Shivaay.Runway 34 is set to release in theatres on April 29 and Ajay is anxious, already. The Bollywood superstar exclusively told IndiaToday.in about the release jitters he’s been feeling. He said, ""I don't know what I'm feeling right now because I have been just running from pillar to post to finish the post-production. So once the release comes closer, then I'll start feeling something. Having said that, there is a certain kind of nervousness, not butterflies, but you're anxious more than nervous that you want to know what the result is. Because you work so hard and feel a certain way that the film should perform, at least appreciation-wise. So that anxiousness is there to know 'ab kya hoga'.""Ajay's last directorial was Shivaay (2016) and now, after more than six years, the Tanhaji actor jumped onto the directorial’ s seat again. Reasoning it out, Ajay shared, ""I was too occupied for a couple of years. Also, I was producing films, so I had to give a lot to that. Last was Tanahji (2020). Then during the pandemic, we started working on the script and that's the time I really got to work on a script properly, design, and make it. So it was just that because there was time for me and I got a fabulous idea and a great script. It is inspired by a true incident and then we took it forward, worked on the script and it shaped up so well that I thought should be made immediately.""The film is inspired by the true event of the Jet Airways Doha to Kochi flight 9W 555, which had a narrow escape on August 18, 2015, after facing difficulties landing at the Cochin International Airport due to bad weather. Did Ajay know about the incident before working on the film? ""No, not really. I knew about the incident but I didn't know the details of the incident. So when somebody came to me about the incident and when I read about it, it sounded very exciting. It is very interesting and more than that I loved the characters in the film,” he said.A post shared by Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn)Ajay Devgn will play the role of Captain Vikrant Khanna in Runway 34. Speaking about the real-life persona, the actor said, ""This man also is brilliant, he has got a great mind. He is fab at his job. But he is somewhere a rule breaker. So he's somewhere grey. He likes to do things on his own terms and conditions and that is a change for him. So the whole film has got a little bit of a mystery that, what he did? Is he doing it out of arrogance? Or did he do it right? Did it fall in place or it was just by chance? So all that part was very interesting for me.""Runway 34 releases on April 29.",2022-04-27,"Why did Ajay Devgn hop onto the director's seat with Runway 34 after Shivaay?

123,124,Eight space missions score big in 2022 appraisal season,"After spending years and for some even a decade on an alien world, eight spacecraft have got a new life as Nasa has extended their services. While some of these vehicles are trundling on the surface of Mars, others are cruising towards asteroids, orbiting the Moon, and even trying to go into interstellar space, escaping the solar system.Eight space missions launched by Nasa got a booster after Nasa evaluated their scientific productivity and potential to deepen our knowledge and understanding of the solar system and beyond.These missions include Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity Rover), InSight lander, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, OSIRIS-REx, and New Horizons. While most of these missions have got renewed life for three years, the OSIRIS-REx has been given a nine-year extension and InSight will be continued until the end of 2022.“Extended missions provide us with the opportunity to leverage NASA’s large investments in exploration, allowing continued science operations at a cost far lower than developing a new mission,"" Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA said in a statement.The eight missions that have been given a new life include:OSIRIS-APEX: The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx), which is currently on its way to Earth after picking up core samples from asteroid Bennu, will keep on pushing. After coming close to Earth, it will deploy the sample case and head on to its new target, Apophis, an asteroid roughly 1,200 feet (roughly 370 meters) in diameter that will come within 32,000 kilometers of Earth in 2029. The spacecraft will study changes in the asteroid caused by its close flyby of Earth and use the spacecraft’s gas thrusters to attempt to dislodge and study the dust and small rocks on and below Apophis’ surface.MAVEN: The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission is planning to study the interaction between Mars’ atmosphere and magnetic field during the upcoming solar maximum. According to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, its observations as the Sun’s activity level increases toward the maximum of its 11-year cycle will deepen our understanding of how Mars’ upper atmosphere and magnetic field interact with the Sun.InSight: Breathing its final breaths on Mars, the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and Heat Transport (InSight) mission will keep providing its services till the end of 2022. It will continue seismic and weather monitoring if the spacecraft remains healthy. The spacecraft, which is on the Martian surface has been suffering due to dust accumulation, which is killing it by blocking the sunlight from reaching the solar panels.LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER: Hovering around the Moon, JPL said that LRO will continue to study the surface and geology of Earth's natural satellite. The extension of services will allow it to study new regions away from the poles in unprecedented detail, including the Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the poles where water ice may be found.MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY: The Mars Science Laboratory and its Curiosity rover have driven more than 16 miles (27 km) on the surface of Mars. Now, it will climb to higher elevations, exploring the critical sulfate-bearing layers that give unique insights into the history of water on Mars.NEW HORIZONS: The mission flew past Pluto in 2015 and the Kuiper Belt object (KBO) Arrokoth in 2019. Now that its mission has been extended for the second time, New Horizons will continue to explore the distant solar system out to 63 astronomical units (AU) from Earth.MARS ODYSSEY: The Odyssey orbiter is providing unique support for real-time data relay from other Mars spacecraft. It will perform new thermal studies of rocks and ice below Mars’ surface, monitor the radiation environment, and continue its long-running climate monitoring campaign.MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER: MRO will study the evolution of Mars’ surface, ices, active geology, and atmosphere and climate. In addition, MRO will continue to provide important data relay service to other Mars missions.Currently, Nasa is operating 14 spacecraft across the solar system and has about 12 missions in the formulation and implementation phase with space agencies from different countries. A mission extension to eight of these missions is set to provide a wealth of data about our planetary neighbourhood and the realms beyond the solar system.",2022-04-27,"Eight space missions score big in 2022 appraisal seasonAfter spending years and for some even a decade on an alien world, eight spacecraft have got a new life as Nasa has extended their services.

124,125,Muslim law board calls attempts to introduce Uniform Civil Code unconstitutional,"The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has said that any attempt to introduce a Uniform Civil Code would be “an unconstitutional and anti-minorities move”.The AIMPLB’s comment came just a few days after Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the state was planning to introduce a Uniform Civil Code. “One law for all in one country is the need of the hour. It is required that we get out of the system of one law for one person and another for others. We are in favour of a common civil code,” he had said.WATCH | Now, Himachal Pradesh CM Jairam Thakur bats for Uniform Civil CodeGeneral Secretary of AIMPLB Hazrat Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani said, “The Constitution of India allows every citizen to lead a life according to his religion, and it has been included in the Fundamental Rights.

128,129,"Sabarmati Ashram redevelopment will preserve Gandhian ethos, Gujarat Govt tells HC amid backlash","The Gujarat government told the High Court that the redevelopment of Sabarmati Ashram would make the place more 'visitor friendly' and preserve the 'Gandhian ethos'. The state government submitted an affidavit dated April 25 in response to the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Tushar Gandhi, great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, who had opposed the redevelopment of the Gandhi ashram.The petitioner had expressed fear that the redevelopment would change the physical structure of Sabarmati Ashram and corrupt its simplicity, which embodied the ideology of Mahatma Gandhi. The petitioner apprehended that the nature of redevelopment and over-sized involvement of government authorities in the conception and execution of the project would make it lose the Gandhian ethos, making it opposite to Gandhian principles.However, the state government refused that the proposed revamp will lose the essence of simplicity and Gandhian ethos.According to the state government, “Merely because the proposed project envisages augmented facilities that are necessary, such as the cafeteria, parking lot, parks, does not mean that it seeks to deviate from the ideology of Gandhiji. The proposed project seeks to make the Gandhi Ashram a more visitor-friendly place It is expected that with the development of the Gandhi Ashram, the number of visitors would increase."" (sic)It further said that four trusts which manage ashram precincts- Sabarmati Ashram Preservation And Memorial Trust (SAPMT), Khadi Gramodyog Prayog Samiti, Harijan Ashram Trust and Sabarmati Ashram Gaushala Trust — have agreed to the proposed project. The trusts have even nominated three trustees who have been inducted in the Governing Council as members of trustees of the newly-made trust- Mahatma Gandhi Sabarmati Ashram Memorial Trust (MGSAMT).For the unversed, after Tushar Gandhi moved the Supreme Court opposing the redevelopment of Sabarmati Ashram, the apex court asked the HC to examine the plea and said that it is not going into the merits of the case. The Gujarat HC had dismissed Gandhi's plea on November 21.ALSO READ| 'Fantastic to be in India': Boris Johnson visits Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad | PicsThe state government in its affidavit stated that the present facilities in the Ashram are not encouraging enough for visitors.

The state government submitted an affidavit dated April 25 in response to the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Tushar Gandhi, great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, who had opposed the redevelopment of the Gandhi ashram.The petitioner had expressed fear that the redevelopment would change the physical structure of Sabarmati Ashram and corrupt its simplicity, which embodied the ideology of Mahatma Gandhi. The petitioner apprehended that the nature of redevelopment and over-sized involvement of government authorities in the conception and execution of the project would make it lose the Gandhian ethos, making it opposite to Gandhian principles.However, the state government refused that the proposed revamp will lose the essence of simplicity and Gandhian ethos.According to the state government, “Merely because the proposed project envisages augmented facilities that are necessary, such as the cafeteria, parking lot, parks, does not mean that it seeks to deviate from the ideology of Gandhiji. The proposed project seeks to make the Gandhi Ashram a more visitor-friendly place It is expected that with the development of the Gandhi Ashram, the number of visitors would increase.""

The trusts have even nominated three trustees who have been inducted in the Governing Council as members of trustees of the newly-made trust- Mahatma Gandhi Sabarmati Ashram Memorial Trust (MGSAMT).For the unversed, after Tushar Gandhi moved the Supreme Court opposing the redevelopment of Sabarmati Ashram, the apex court asked the HC to examine the plea and said that it is not going into the merits of the case. The Gujarat HC had dismissed Gandhi's plea on November 21.ALSO READ| 'Fantastic to be in India': Boris Johnson visits Sabarmati Ashram in Ahmedabad | PicsThe state government in its affidavit stated that the present facilities in the Ashram are not encouraging enough for visitors.

143,144,Deepika Padukone named Cannes 2022 jury member. All about her red carpet looks,"There couldn't be better news for Deepika Padukone as the diva has made it to the list of jury members at the upcoming Cannes Film Festival. Yes, after slaying her way into her fan's hearts with her Cannes appearances, she is now set to represent India with her being a part of a 9-member jury at the 75th edition of the prestigious film festival which reviews and reward one of the 21 films in Competition with the Palme d'Or.Apart from Deepika, other members of the jury this year include Rebecca Hall, Noomi Rapace from Sweden, filmmakers Jasmine Trinca from Italy, Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, Ladj Ly from France, Jeff Nichols from the United States and Joachim Trier from Norway. French actor Vincent Lindon will preside over the Cannes Film Festival`s jury this year and the festival will be held from May 17-28.According to reports, Deepika will be making her big appearance at Cannes this year, as part of her collaboration with Louis Vuitton, a French luxury fashion house and company. Moreover, the actress has also been signed as one of the global ambassadors of the brand and her Instagram feed is already a proof of her association with the popular luxury house.Now, Bollywood divas always make a style statement at the Cannes Film Festival every year, but Deepika Padukone is one of the very few who has nailed every look. In fact, she is one of the constants at the red carpet since a last couple of years and if looked closely, one can even trace the evolution of her sartorial choices.With just a few years in the industry, the diva managed to grab eyeballs. While Hollywood celebrities sizzled in western gowns at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, she made India proud in France in a beautiful white and golden Rohit Bal saree. Deepika Padukone wore a low back blouse with embellished strings pulling it together. She opted for a low bun, showing off her tattoo and completed the look with a Kundan earrings and a matching bindi.In 2017, Deepika turned up the heat in a bold dark purple Marchesa Notte ensemble as she walked down the Cannes red carpet representing cosmetics brands - L'Oreal Paris.Her second appearance in the same year was equally impressive as she chose an emerald green Brandon Maxwell one-shoulder gown with a long train and a thigh-high slit. She had aptly teamed her stunning outfit with heels by Chloe Gosselin and chose accessories by de Grisogono. A high bun and statement earrings rounded off her look.Similarly in 2018, Deepika turned heads by donning a hot pink gown from Ashi Studio’s collection. She completed her look with matching stilettoes, smokey eyes and a chic hairdo. And if this wasn't enough, Deepika left her fans asking for more when she walked down the red carpet in white Zuhair Murad gown, posing for thousands of cameras, looking like a million bucks.That's right, she cast a spell on the onlookers with her everlasting beauty and breathtakingly beautiful ensemble that featured a flowy cape and intricate work.Deepika was a vision in 2019 when she stepped out in a lime green tulle tiered gown from Giambattista Valli. Her outfit featured a long train and it was accessorized with a rose gold floral headwrap from Emily-London. She looked elegant even in her black and white Dundas couture gown.So yes, with her stunning outfits, minimum accessories and on point makeup, Deepika has surely looked nothing less than alluring in each of her Cannes appearance over the years and now all eyes are on her as she is set to walk down the red carpet as one of the jury members this year in May.",2022-04-27,"Deepika Padukone named Cannes 2022 jury member.

144,145,Vijay Babu sexual assault case: What the victim has said against the Kerala actor,"A female actor in the Malayalam film industry has accused actor Vijay Babu of sexually assaulting her for over one month. The victim has alleged that the accused, Vijay Babu, physically assaulted her and sexually exploited her from March 13 to April 14, 2022.However, Vijay Babu, in his Facebook Live post, has dismissed these allegations and said that he has not done anything wrong. Further, he said that he would file a defamation suit and “won’t let her go that easily.”The actress/victim, in a post on the Facebook group named Women Against Sexual Harassment, has elaborated the details of the alleged sexual assault.The victim, in the post, began by saying that she had known him for a few years in the industry and had worked together with him for a movie.She alleged that throughout this time he had gained her trust by being friendly and advising her, as she was a newcomer in the film industry with no proper guidance.“He behaved like my saviour for my personal and professional problems but, under the guise, has sexually exploited me,” claimed the victim.The victim alleged that the accused, Vijay Babu, had intoxicated her and sexually abused her without consent.“Whenever I was conscious, I refused consent to sex. But for him it was never an issue and, disregarding my protest, he has raped me several times during the past one-and-a half months,” she said.“When I was incapable of saying yes or no consciously, he used my body as a tool for his pleasure. He has forced himself on me and even forced me into oral sex in a car against my will. I was in a state of shock, incapable of talking or responding,” the victim said on the Facebook post.“I was under his control and was scared to speak up because of the clout , influence and power he wielded in the film industry. It was a trap to use me,” says the victim.The victim also detailed the assault that Vijay Babu allegedly did to her.“One day, for denying sex, he stamped forcefully on my stomach when I was on my periods. He spit sputum on my face and forced himself on me against my will. I was too traumatised to realise what was happening at that time but today I realise I was subjected to rape,” alleged the victim.The victim also revealed that she had discovered that there were several other women who had been subjected to this trap by Vijay Babu.“He has recorded a nude video of mine and threatened me with its consequences and also threatened my life. I fear for his blackmail and for my safety. I am not keeping my mouth shut anymore. I can't take this pain anymore. I strongly believe I will get justice for the sexual and physical assaults I have gone through by Vijay Babu. No one should go through this pain and trauma anymore in their life,” she said.“I ask all the women who had this experience from him and are silenced to speak up because together we can stop him from exploiting another girl,” she said in the post.The rape case against Malayalam actor and producer Vijay Babu has shocked the Malayalam Industry. The Ernakulam South police had registered a case against Vijay Babu on April 22, based on a complaint lodged by a young woman actress.In the complaint, she alleged that Vijaya Babu tortured her several times at his apartment in Ernakulam on a promise that she would get lots of opportunities from him in the cinema industry. Later, Vijay Babu was charged with rape and causing grievous bodily harm. The police have not yet been able to question Vijaya Babu.However, on April 26 , Vijay Babu came on Facebook live and alleged that the young woman actress was torturing him. Vijaya Babu also alleged that he was the 'real victim' and revealed the identity of the young actress.

154,155,Order successfully delivered: Our DNA came from deep space,"As we go deep into the universe to look for another rock that could harbour life, we are still trying to figure out how the process of life jumpstarted on Earth. Analysis of meteorites has now shown that the chemical ingredients of life were delivered to Earth from deep space.A team of researchers from the Institute of Low-Temperature Science (ILTS) at Hokkaido University has reported the discovery of nucleobases in three carbonaceous meteorites. Nucleobases are nitrogen-containing compounds crucial in forming DNA's characteristic double-helix structure.The study published in the journal Nature Communications states that the researchers identify various pyrimidine nucleobases such as cytosine, uracil, and thymine, and their structural isomers such as isocytosine, imidazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 6-methyluracil. It is to be noted that the DNA is made up of nucleobases called adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), meanwhile, RNA, also uses A, C and G, but swaps out thymine for uracil (U).The researchers examined material from three meteorites - one that fell in 1950 near the town of Murray in the U.S. state of Kentucky, one that fell in 1969 near the town of Murchison in Australia's Victoria state, and one that fell in 2000 near Tagish Lake in Canada's British Columbia province.All three are classified as carbonaceous chondrites, made of rocky material thought to have formed early in the solar system's history. They are carbon-rich, with the Murchison and Murray meteorites containing about 2% organic carbon by weight and the Tagish Lake meteorite containing about 4% organic carbon. Carbon is a primary constituent of organisms on Earth.The confirmation of an extraterrestrial origin of a complete set of nucleobases found in DNA and RNA buttresses the theory that meteorites could have been an important source of organic compounds necessary for the emergence of Earth's first living organisms.Scientists the world over have been engaged in understanding the process behind the beginning of life on the planet. They have been trying to unfold the mysterious circumstances on Earth that enabled various chemical compounds to come together in a warm watery setting to form a living microbe able to reproduce itself.""There is still much to learn about the chemical steps that led to the origin of life on Earth - the first self-replicating system. This research certainly adds to the list of chemical compounds that would have been present in the early Earth's prebiotic (existing before the emergence of life) soup,"" Danny Glavin of NASA's Goddard Space Flight and co-author of the study told Reuters.The two nucleobases, called cytosine and thymine, newly identified in the meteorites may have eluded detection in previous examinations because they possess a more delicate structure than the other three, the researchers said.The five nucleobases would not have been the only chemical compounds necessary for life. Among other things needed were: amino acids, which are components of proteins and enzymes; sugars, which are part of the DNA and RNA backbone; and fatty acids, which are structural components of cell membranes.""This study demonstrates that a diversity of meteoritic nucleobases could serve as building blocks of DNA and RNA on the early Earth,"" the paper read.",2022-04-27,"Order successfully delivered: Our DNA came from deep spaceAs we go deep into the universe to look for another rock that could harbour life, we are still trying to figure out how the process of life jumpstarted on Earth.

157,158,Order successfully delivered: Our DNA came from deep space,"As we go deep into the universe to look for another rock that could harbour life, we are still trying to figure out how the process of life jumpstarted on Earth. Analysis of meteorites has now shown that the chemical ingredients of life were delivered to Earth from deep space.A team of researchers from the Institute of Low-Temperature Science (ILTS) at Hokkaido University has reported the discovery of nucleobases in three carbonaceous meteorites. Nucleobases are nitrogen-containing compounds crucial in forming DNA's characteristic double-helix structure.The study published in the journal Nature Communications states that the researchers identify various pyrimidine nucleobases such as cytosine, uracil, and thymine, and their structural isomers such as isocytosine, imidazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 6-methyluracil. It is to be noted that the DNA is made up of nucleobases called adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), meanwhile, RNA, also uses A, C and G, but swaps out thymine for uracil (U).The researchers examined material from three meteorites - one that fell in 1950 near the town of Murray in the U.S. state of Kentucky, one that fell in 1969 near the town of Murchison in Australia's Victoria state, and one that fell in 2000 near Tagish Lake in Canada's British Columbia province.All three are classified as carbonaceous chondrites, made of rocky material thought to have formed early in the solar system's history. They are carbon-rich, with the Murchison and Murray meteorites containing about 2% organic carbon by weight and the Tagish Lake meteorite containing about 4% organic carbon. Carbon is a primary constituent of organisms on Earth.The confirmation of an extraterrestrial origin of a complete set of nucleobases found in DNA and RNA buttresses the theory that meteorites could have been an important source of organic compounds necessary for the emergence of Earth's first living organisms.Scientists the world over have been engaged in understanding the process behind the beginning of life on the planet. They have been trying to unfold the mysterious circumstances on Earth that enabled various chemical compounds to come together in a warm watery setting to form a living microbe able to reproduce itself.""There is still much to learn about the chemical steps that led to the origin of life on Earth - the first self-replicating system. This research certainly adds to the list of chemical compounds that would have been present in the early Earth's prebiotic (existing before the emergence of life) soup,"" Danny Glavin of NASA's Goddard Space Flight and co-author of the study told Reuters.The two nucleobases, called cytosine and thymine, newly identified in the meteorites may have eluded detection in previous examinations because they possess a more delicate structure than the other three, the researchers said.The five nucleobases would not have been the only chemical compounds necessary for life.

Among other things needed were: amino acids, which are components of proteins and enzymes; sugars, which are part of the DNA and RNA backbone; and fatty acids, which are structural components of cell membranes.""This study demonstrates that a diversity of meteoritic nucleobases could serve as building blocks of DNA and RNA on the early Earth,"" the paper read.",order successfully delivered dna came deep spaceas go deep universe look another rock could harbour life still trying figure process life jumpstarted earth analysis meteorite shown chemical ingredient life delivered earth deep space team researcher institute low temperature science ilts hokkaido university reported discovery nucleobases three carbonaceous meteorite nucleobases nitrogen containing compound crucial forming dna characteristic double helix structure study published journal nature communication state researcher identify various pyrimidine nucleobases cytosine uracil thymine structural isomer isocytosine imidazole carboxylic acid methyluracil noted dna made nucleobases called adenine thymine cytosine guanine meanwhile rna also us swap thymine uracil researcher examined material three meteorite one fell near town murray state kentucky one fell near town murchison australia victoria state one fell near tagish lake canada british columbia province three classified carbonaceous chondrite made rocky material thought formed early solar system history carbon rich murchison murray meteorite containing organic carbon weight tagish lake meteorite containing organic carbon carbon primary constituent organism earth confirmation extraterrestrial origin complete set nucleobases found dna rna buttress theory meteorite could important source organic compound necessary emergence earth first living organism scientist world engaged understanding process behind beginning life planet trying unfold mysterious circumstance earth enabled various chemical compound come together warm watery setting form living microbe able reproduce still much learn chemical step led origin life earth first self replicating system research certainly add list chemical compound would present early earth prebiotic existing emergence life soup danny glavin nasa goddard space flight co author study told reuters two nucleobases called cytosine thymine newly identified meteorite may eluded detection previous examination posse delicate structure three researcher said five nucleobases would chemical compound necessary life among thing needed amino acid component protein enzyme sugar part dna rna backbone fatty acid structural component cell membrane study demonstrates diversity meteoritic nucleobases could serve building block dna rna early earth paper read ,"[-1.27426913e-01  9.92292097e-02  4.60517100e-02 -5.31984482e-02

159,160,"Yamuna Expressway Authority approves Rs 4,528 crore budget for 2022-23 | Details","The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) on Tuesday approved a budget of Rs 4,528 crore to be spent in the financial year 2022-23 on different developmental projects across the city.The authority has set aside Rs 1,535 crore in expenditure for land acquisition, three times more than last year's allocation.The project, Master Plan-2041 Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Area (YEIDA) (Phase-I) aims at sustainable development, evolving development vision and a road map for balanced growth of the region by regulating future spatial development to be envisaged for the horizon year, 2041.CEO Yamuna Development Authority Arunveer Singh said, ""The vision is a sustainable, efficient, well-connected and globally recognized city that capitalizes on the economic opportunity surrounding the Noida International Airport and economic corridors while ensuring the highest living standards for its citizens”.""YEIDA has huge potential for various small and medium scale industries, including cottage industries. Hence, the plan includes a major sector of industrial development. Provision for logistics facilities is also to be planned in order to fulfil future industrial demands. Heritage and cultural aspects may not be prominent in YEIDA at present. But the city will act as a gateway for the region due to the upcoming International Airport,"" he added.The Yamuna Expressway Authority has also allocated Rs 76.98 crore for the smart village project.The area is bounded by the Greater Noida Authority in the North, Bulandshahar and Khurja Development Authorities in the East, and Aligarh District in the South. Apart from the Proposed Yamuna and Eastern Peripheral Expressways running through the area, the other proposed expressways like the Ganga and Upper Ganga Canal expressways are also proposed in its close vicinity.The Master Plan 2041 promotes more mixed-use development and industrial development. YEIDA population is estimated to be 41.7 lakhs by 2041. To cater to this growth, it is estimated that the area requires 8 lakh homes, 1,200 hectares of commercial space and 4,000 hectares of industrial land. Based on the vision, the existing scenario, projections and potential of the area master plan 2041 is proposed.Some major proposals include Aerotropolis, Central Business District, Olympic city and the transportation sector. Smart infrastructure for logistics, E-commerce, Intermodal Freight Hub, office parks and corridors, hotels, entertainment, retail clusters, wellness and medical centers, mixed use residential clusters are the key components of the airport city-side development.This new zone expects to create a high-density district with a distinct character and a clearly identifiable urban form. The land used in this central commercial core would include a mix of offices, retail and other business uses, along with some residential developments.Physical proposals include proposing arterial, sub arterial, collector and local roads, which constitute 13 percent of the total area.Meanwhile, public transport proposals include metro and Neo metro extensions, city bus network and routes. In addition to this, proposals for inter-state bus terminals, freight corridors, depots are also presented.A major component of transport is parking and the plan covers this aspect very well by giving provisions for on-street and off-street parking. 3 multi-modal hubs are proposed along the Yamuna Expressway.READ MORE| Noida authority approves Rs 4,880 crore budget for 2022-23 | DetailsREAD MORE| Noida authority approves Rs 757 crore budget for Jewar airport",2022-04-27,"Yamuna Expressway Authority approves Rs 4,528 crore budget for 2022-23 | DetailsThe Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) on Tuesday approved a budget of Rs 4,528 crore to be spent in the financial year 2022-23 on different developmental projects across the city.The authority has set aside Rs 1,535 crore in expenditure for land acquisition, three times more than last year's allocation.The project, Master Plan-2041 Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Area (YEIDA) (Phase-I) aims at sustainable development, evolving development vision and a road map for balanced growth of the region by regulating future spatial development to be envisaged for the horizon year, 2041.CEO Yamuna Development Authority Arunveer Singh said, ""The vision is a sustainable, efficient, well-connected and globally recognized city that capitalizes on the economic opportunity surrounding the Noida International Airport and economic corridors while ensuring the highest living standards for its citizens”.""YEIDA has huge potential for various small and medium scale industries, including cottage industries.

165,166,"Wordle 312 word of the day, April 27. 3 clues to help you guess the answer in a jiffy","Hey puzzlers! Were you able to solve today’s Wordle? We are sure you had a lot of fun solving yesterday’s puzzle because of its reference to the popular TV series Money Heist. Today’s word of the day is as easy as it gets. Let’s start with a hint. We use this word when we want to imply something that is displayed.HOW TO PLAY WORDLE?Wordle is a simple word-guessing game and requires the player to guess a five-letter word in six tries. The game is available on a website and you can play it from your mobile as well as laptop or computer. There is a grid and a keyboard on the Wordle website and you can choose your letters from it.To start, you have to type your first five-letter word guess. That forms the top row of the grid. If you get one of the letters correct in the grid, that box will turn green. If the letter that you guessed is in the word but not in the correct box, that space will turn yellow. If the player guesses anything else, the tile’s colour remains unchanged.STRATEGIES TO PLAY WORDLE BETTERTip #1: While playing Wordle, try to use letters that are common. The most common letters in the English language are e, t, a, i, o, n, s, h, and r. Try using these in the first few attempts.Tip #2: Don't waste your attempts on words that have a letter you've already eliminated, or letters in a position that they cannot be in.Tip #3: During your initial attempts, if a letter is marked yellow, it cannot be in the same position in any of the following guesses. It will also not be in any position that has already turned green. This means that you do not have to try all four remaining slots for a yellow letter.Tip #4: Think of words with common letters and give it a shot.WORDLE AND ITS INDIA CONNECTWordle was invented by Josh Wardle, a software engineer from Brooklyn, for his Indian partner, Palak Shah, who loves word games. The name of the game is in line with the creator’s surname Wardle. Palak and Josh played the game for several months before its release in October 2021, The New York Times reports.

A 300-year-old Shiva temple was among the temples demolished. The protesters are demanding the reconstruction of the temples at the same site.WATCH | Bulldozers demolish 300-year-old temple in Rajasthan's AlwarAlwar MP Balaknath and many monks are participating in the rally that’s marching from the Shaheed Smaarak (martyrs’ memorial) to the collectorate. The police put up barricades to stop the protesters, shouting “Jai Shree Ram”.Locals said that the authorities did not let the idols in the temple be removed. When India Today went to the spot, it saw broken pieces of idols lying around.The BJP and the ruling Congress have traded charges over the demolition of the temples. While Rajasthan BJP president Satish Poonia accused the Congress of being behind the demolition, state Congress chief Govind Singh Dotasra asserted that it was the decision of the city’s municipality, headed by the saffron party.ALSO READ | Alwar temple razed to divert attention from FIR against Congress MLA’s son, says BJPThe district administration claims that due legal procedure was followed in the demolition procedure and notices were issued.The BJP said local Congress MLA Johori Lala Meena was present at the meeting where the decision to demolish temples was taken.

It has also formed a committee to look into the demands for compensation claims and the legality of the demolition.The Congress has also raked up the issue of the demolition of nearly 100 temples in 2015 in Jaipur under the BJP's Vasundhara Raje government.

169,170,Elon Musk owns Twitter but will Tesla pay the price?,"Elon Musk is the proud owner of Twitter, but the world's richest person's move to buy the social media platform has so far proved to be a cause of concern for Tesla. The world's most valuable automaker lost $126 billion in value on Tuesday.Tesla's share price fell by 12.18 per cent to $876.42 on the US stock market, Nasdaq, on Tuesday.Tesla is not involved in the Twitter deal, yet the company's shares have been targeted by speculators after Musk declined to disclose publicly where his cash for the acquisition is coming from.Tesla's multi-billion loss in its value came amid investors' apprehensions that Chief Executive Musk may have to sell shares to fund his $21 billion equity contribution to his $44 billion buyout of Twitter.Interestingly, the 12.18 per cent drop in Tesla's shares on Tuesday equated to a $21 billion drop in the value of Musk's stake in the company, the same as the $21 billion in cash he committed to the Twitter deal.Tesla's share plunge came against a challenging backdrop for many technology-related stocks. The Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since December 2020 on Tuesday, as investors worried about slowing global growth and more aggressive rate hikes from the US.Twitter's shares also slid on Tuesday, falling 3.9 per cent to close at $49.68 even though Musk agreed to buy it on Monday for $54.20 per share in cash.The widening spread reflects investor concern that the precipitous decline in Tesla's shares, from which Musk derives the majority of his $239 billion fortune, could lead the world's richest person to have second thoughts about the Twitter deal, according to Reuters.Market experts opined that worries about upcoming stock sales by Musk and the possibility that he is becoming distracted by Twitter weighed on Tesla shares. If Tesla's share price continues to tumble, it would jeopardize his financing, experts said.As part of the Tesla deal, Musk also took out a $12.5 billion margin loan tied to his Tesla stock.

170,171,Major Japan railway now powered only by renewable energy,"Tokyo’s Shibuya is famed for its Scramble Crossing, where crowds of people crisscross the intersection in a scene symbolizing urban Japan’s congestion and anonymity. It may have added another boasting right.Tokyu Railways’ trains running through Shibuya and other stations were switched to power generated only by solar and other renewable sources starting April 1.That means the carbon dioxide emissions of Tokyu’s sprawling network of seven train lines and one tram service now stand at zero, with green energy being used at all its stations, including for vending machines for drinks, security camera screens and lighting.Tokyu, which employs 3,855 people and connects Tokyo with nearby Yokohama, is the first railroad operator in Japan to have achieved that goal. It says the carbon dioxide reduction is equivalent to the annual average emissions of 56,000 Japanese households.Nicholas Little, director of railway education at Michigan State University’s Center for Railway Research and Education, commends Tokyu for promoting renewable energy but stressed the importance of boosting the bottom-line amount of that renewable energy.“I would stress the bigger impacts come from increasing electricity generation from renewable sources,” he said. “The long-term battle is to increase production of renewable electricity and provide the transmission infrastructure to get it to the places of consumption.”The technology used by Tokyu’s trains is among the most ecologically friendly options for railways. The other two options are batteries and hydrogen power.And so is it just a publicity stunt, or is Tokyu moving in the right direction?Ryo Takagi, a professor at Kogakuin University and specialist in electric railway systems, believes the answer isn’t simple because how train technology evolves is complex and depends on many uncertain societal factors.In a nutshell, Tokyu’s efforts are definitely not hurting and are probably better than doing nothing. They show the company is taking up the challenge of promoting clean energy, he said.“But I am not going out of my way to praise it as great,” Takagi said.Bigger gains would come from switching from diesel trains in rural areas to hydrogen powered lines and from switching gas-guzzling cars to electric, he said.Tokyu paid an undisclosed amount to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility behind the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, for certification vouching for its use of renewables, even as Japan continues to use coal and other fossil fuels.“We don’t see this as reaching our goal but just a start,” said Assistant Manager Yoshimasa Kitano at Tokyu’s headquarters, a few minutes’ walk from the Scramble Crossing.Such steps are crucial for Japan, the world’s sixth-biggest carbon emitter, to attain its goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050.Only about 20% of Japan’s electricity comes from renewable sources, according to the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, a Tokyo-based independent non-profit research organization.That lags way behind New Zealand, for instance, where 84% of power used comes from renewable energy sources. New Zealand hopes to make that 100% by 2035.The renewable sources driving Tokyu trains include hydropower, geothermal-power, wind power and solar power, according to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that provides the electricity and tracks its energy sourcing.Tokyu has more than 100 kilometers (64 miles) of railway tracks serving 2.2 million people a day, including commuting “salarymen” and “salarywomen” and schoolchildren in uniforms.Since the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, when a tsunami set off by a massive earthquake sent three reactors into meltdowns, Japan has shut down most of its nuclear plants and ramped up use of coal-fired power plants.The country aims to have 36%-38% of its energy come from renewable sources by 2030, while slashing overall energy use.Tokyu Railways has sought to publicize its effort with posters and YouTube clips.Still, Ryuichi Yagi, who heads his own company that used to make neckties but has switched to wallets appeared surprised to learn he was riding on a “green train.”“I had no idea,” he said.Yagi switched his business because of Japan’s “cool biz” movement. It encourages male office workers to doff their suits for open-necked short-sleeve shirts to conserve energy by keeping air conditioning to a minimum in hot summer months.In a sense, he said, “I lead a very green life.”",2022-04-27,"Major Japan railway now powered only by renewable energyTokyo’s Shibuya is famed for its Scramble Crossing, where crowds of people crisscross the intersection in a scene symbolizing urban Japan’s congestion and anonymity.

Two mall security guards and five staff of Lost Lemons bar, where the incident took place, have been arrested.A total of nine people have been connected to the murder and eight of them have been identified, while the identity of the last man remains unknown. One of the accused is absconding and police have started a hunt to nab the person.A 30-year-old man, Brijesh Rai from Chapra, Bihar, was allegedly thrashed to death by the bouncers of Lost Lemons Bar at Gardens Galleria mall in Noida’s Sector-38 on Monday night.An argument had broken out over the payment of the bill. The argument soon escalated into a brawl, where bouncers thrashed Brijesh and fatally injured him.Brijesh was taken to a hospital but was declared “brought dead”.According to Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, Noida, Ranvijay Singh, the initial investigation revealed that the people at the bar had a fight over the bill. “The statements of the people present with Brijesh will also be taken, after which the real reason for the murder will be known,” he said.Meanwhile, an investigative reporter from India Today reached out to two of the pub staff taken into police custody for questioning.The detained men claimed that the guest had been trying to avoid paying the bill, which led to an argument with one of the pub employees.The first suspect said, “The man, who has now expired, stepped into our outlet. He was already drunk.”“He took some more drinks inside. He was evasive when asked about paying the bill. He kept telling the staff to come 15, 20, 30 minutes later. All this led to an argument (between him and the pub staff). By that time, mall security was alerted. The man, however, settled the bill and was moved out.”The pub staff said that the mall security had beat up the guest.“The mall security came in and beat him up. They had an argument and they slapped him. We didn’t beat him. There was only one man from our staff who slapped him once,” said the staff member in custody. “He was beaten to the floor.
