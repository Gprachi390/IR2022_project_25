2,ECB to appoint separate coaches for red-ball and white-ball formats ,"The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has invited applications for two head coaches after sacking Chris Silverwood following the national team’s disastrous campaign in the Ashes. The England cricketing setup has undergone plenty of changes following the 0-4 loss to Pat Cummins’ Australia Down Under.Yorkshire-born Joe Root has stepped down as the Three Lions’ Test skipper after the away series against the West Indies. After Silverwood’s departure, the ECB appointed former all-rounder Paul Collingwood as the interim head coach.Earlier, retired batter Rob Key was also named as the managing director of the men’s team. The changes have come to the fore after the Brits have won only one of their last 17 Tests.""The head coaches will report to Robert Key, the managing director of England men's cricket, and will have overall responsibility for the performance and management of the England men's team in the relevant formats covered by the roles,"" the advertisement read.Recently, Ravi Shastri, the former head coach of the Indian team, showed Key the blueprint to succeed during his stint with the England team. Key worked as a commentator before taking up the job at the ECB.""Rob may have more work with the domestic game but, when it comes to the national team, it is very similar. The most important thing is getting among the players and setting a tone from the outset: what you believe in, what you think of them and changing the mindset to compete and win.“You have to be bullish and brutish in wanting to achieve that. For us, and now England, it was about setting the challenge of winning abroad, big time,"" Shastri was quoted as saying.England employed the double head coach formula between 2012 and 2014. During that time, while Andy Flower was the Test coach, Ashley Giles worked as the coach in ODIs and T20Is.",2022-04-27
3,Fact Check: 2020 video shared with false claim that Muslims offered loud prayers on streets after clampdown on loudspeakers in UP,"Recently, the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government ordered places of worship to lower the volumes of loudspeakers. Speakers were also removed from 125 places, as per the Additional Director General (Law and Order) of the UP Police. In its aftermath, a video of Muslim men standing on a road while offering prayers loudly went viral with the claim that this was in response to Adityanath’s orders.A Sudarshan News journalist tweeted the video, asking if shouting prayers, as seen in the video, was an alternative to loudspeakers. The video was also shared by the official Sudarshan News Twitter account, at least twice.The Sudarshan News Twitter account also called it an alternative to bans on loudspeakers. The news channel’s founder Suresh Chavhanke too shared the video with the same claim. The videos shared by all of them bore the Sudarshan News watermark.?..., .#BahutSaralHu pic.twitter.com/TpXl1Ri88jThe video was widely shared on Facebook as well.Archived versions of these claims can be seen here and here.The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the video was almost two-year-old and was not from Uttar Pradesh but from Howrah in West Bengal.A reverse search of keyframes of the video led us to a Tweet from April 19, 2020, where a person shared a screengrab from the same video uploaded to Facebook by someone named Nitin Thakur.pic.twitter.com/RhEzb4IQgxWe then went through the feed of Nitin Thakur and came across a better quality of the viral video shared on April 17, 2020.The same video was shared by another Twitter user on April 8, 2020. This proved the video was not recent.In the video, we noticed white and blue pavement railings, something that’s a staple of the All India Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal government. A comparison with a photo of a Kolkata pavement railing carried by Ei Samay, a Bengali-language daily from the Times Group can be seen below.We also noticed the signage of a Biryani Shop named ""Shimla Biryani"" written in Bangla in the video, hinting that this video was likely from West Bengal.Dr. Rai confirmed to India Today that the viral video was from Pilkhana in Howrah. He explained that the video was from when all places of worship, including mosques, were shut down during the first 21-day phase of the national lockdown imposed to combat Covid-19.While we couldn't pinpoint the exact date on which the video was recorded, we concluded that this 2020 video from Howrah was definitely not in response to the recent clampdown on loudspeakers in UP.The number of crows determines the intensity of the lie.",2022-04-27

6,"Neutrality won’t help stop war, says Ukraine's foreign minister on India’s position | Exclusive","The Russia-Ukraine war continues unabated, more than two months after Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the invasion in a televised address on February 24.In the days since then, countries across the globe have taken a side, or chosen not to. India belongs to the second category. India has maintained that it is on the side of peace and appealed to both Russia and Ukraine to end the war; however, it has consistently abstained from taking an explicit position against either of the two countries at war.In an exclusive interview with India Today’s Rajdeep Sardesai, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Wednesday that neutrality is a position that does not help in stopping the war.Dmytro Kuleba (@DmytroKuleba), Ukraine's Foreign Minister speaks of the challenges that the Ukrainian troops face against relentless Russian attacks.'I know that #India enjoys a special relationship with #Russia, but this Russia is different', He also said@sardesairajdeep pic.twitter.com/swUIqQOfNsHe said, “We appreciate the sympathy coming from the leadership of India for Ukraine. We also appreciate the position of India that the war must stop. At the same time, I must mention that under these circumstances, neutrality is the position that doesn’t help in stopping the war. The best way to stop the war is to support Ukraine and leave Russia with no illusions that it may win the war.”“So, in my view, in times when you have an obvious criminal and a victim of his crime, it’s a moral and politically wise duty to be on the side of the victim,” he added.Recognising that India shares an important relationship with Russia, Dmytro Kuleba said, ""One point should be taken into account. This Russia is different from the one India was developing a special relationship with. This Russia tortures, kills, rapes and manipulates. This Russia is in strategic decline. I hope Indian leadership will stand on the right side of history.""Further, he said that the Russia-Ukraine war is also a war between the democratic world and an authoritarian once. Hence, he emphasised that it would be the ""most natural choice"" for India, as a big democratic country, to stand by democracy.Dmytro Kuleba also said that Russia is not as ""reliable"" a supplier of defence equipment to India as generally assumed.""Ukraine has effectively destroyed the most advanced Russian weapons on the battleground. So is it really in India's interest to buy weapons which don’t survive on the battleground?"" he asked.He said that India should choose its trade partners strategically as ""India is on the rise while Russia is in decline"".Speaking to India Today, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said that Russia was conducting warfare in Ukraine in an inhuman and 'barbarian' way.""Russia will bear responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity on Ukrainian territory. Some towns and villages in Donbas don’t exist anymore because Russia razed them to the ground,"" he said.He added that Ukrainian authorities had discovered more than a thousand bodies of civilians, most of them shot, around capital Kyiv.""They didn’t die in bomb attacks. They were shot directly by Russian soldiers. Many had their hands tied behind their backs,"" he described.But even with the extent of brutality in the war, Dmytro Kuleba said he is convinced that Moscow will not use nuclear weapons.""Moscow understands that nuclear war will mean the end of Moscow. I don't know Putin's mind but if there are any remains of reason and wisdom, he will understand that resorting to nuclear weapons will mean the end of Russia,"" he said.He added, ""Russia is engaging in scare-mongering and blackmailing. Russia knows how to perfectly blackmail the world. The last thing we should do is to buy it. We've to remain confident and united.""",2022-04-27
7,Ajay Devgn says Hindi will always be our national language. Twitter fact-checks him,"Ajay Devgn found himself at the receiving end of social media anger after stating that Hindi “was, is, and will always be our national language” during a conversation with Kannada actor Kiccha Sudeep on Twitter on Wednesday. The 53-year-old actor was trolled as the internet fact-checked his statement soon after - there is no national language for India. Hindi, in fact, is India's most used language and is part of the 22 languages listed in the Indian Constitution's eighth schedule.It all started after Kiccha Sudeep said in an exclusive interview with Karnataka Tak recently that Hindi is not a national language anymore. While a certain section of the internet lashed out at the Kannada actor, Ajay Devgn, slightly late though, responded to Sudeep in a tweet in Hindi where he claimed the aforementioned.Ajay’s tweet, translated from Hindi to English, reads, ""Kiccha Sudeep, my brother, according to you, if Hindi is not our national language then why do you release your native language [mother tongue] films by dubbing them in Hindi? Hindi was, is and always will be our mother tongue and national language. Jan Gan Man."".@KicchaSudeep ,?,More on this story later because the internet, as unforgiving as it is, is busy lashing out at Ajay at the moment. With slight undertones of sarcasm, most users advised Ajay to do what his Twitter bio suggests: “I talk more in movies than in real life.” Others opted to help him with a GK lesson.Take a look at the tweets here:#AjayDevgn isliye bollywood ki koi baat serious nhi lete.India ki koi national langauge nhi h.isko bolo eight schedule padhe . ar India ki 5 classical language h Sanskrit ,Odia,Tamil,Telugu, Kannada. ye 5 sbse old sbse rich grammatical language @ajaydevgnFact is currently there is no national language of India.We only have official languages.Shall we have Hindi as one or not is something that could be debatable though #NationalLanguage #AjayDevgnThere is no national language in India. We indians are having 22 official languages.@ajaydevgn @KicchaSudeep #KicchaBOSS #NationalLanguage #AjayDevgn #languageMr.Ajay then why #Hindi movies are dubbed in other languages?? Try and release only in hindi.. #KicchaSudeep #AjayDevgnWhy can’t our public figures be a bit socially responsible in expressing their thoughts, why everyone talks about divide, I think all of them need a course on coexistence hope they do little boasting and more work on ground #verydisappointed #AjayDevgnLOAD !!! AIM !!! SHOOT !!!Straight up nose cut for #AjayDevgn https://t.co/1HbUSrwIB3Hindi is not national language in our India #AjayDevgnTight slap.....#Kannada #kichhasudeep #stopHindiImposition#AjayDevgn #sudeep #NationalLanguage pic.twitter.com/UNWHyMvWJPINDIA HAS NO NATIONAL LANGUAGEFYI, There is no national language in India. @KicchaSudeep was absolutely right. Hindi is another official language of our country and we have all rights to release our films in any languageDoesn’t make sense, even English movies release in Hindi language in india.There is no National language in india, that’s the beauty of our nation, celebrating the diversity without imposing thoughts on others.Don’t do petty politics bro.While this could be a good promotion tactic for the upcoming movie & with due to respect to Hindi language, our country has no national language.It has multiple official languages including Hindi, English & multiple regional languages.But, no national language. This is known.As for Kiccha Sudeep and Ajay Devgn’s controversial Twitter conversation, the story stretched pretty far. Kiccha Sudeep responded to Ajay, saying that he didn’t intend to “provoke or to start any debate.”Hello @ajaydevgn sir.. the context to why i said tat line is entirely different to the way I guess it has reached you. Probably wil emphasis on why the statement was made when I see you in person. It wasn't to hurt,Provoke or to start any debate. Why would I sir https://t.co/w1jIugFid6And then, this.And sir @ajaydevgn ,,I did understand the txt you sent in hindi. Tats only coz we all have respected,loved and learnt hindi.No offense sir,,,but was wondering what'd the situation be if my response was typed in kannada.!!Don't we too belong to India sir.Ajay’s next move was pure damage control.Hi @KicchaSudeep, You are a friend. thanks for clearing up the misunderstanding. I’ve always thought of the film industry as one. We respect all languages and we expect everyone to respect our language as well. Perhaps, something was lost in translationFinally, there was peace.Translation & interpretations are perspectives sir. Tats the reason not reacting wothout knowing the complete matter,,,matters.:)I don't blame you @ajaydevgn sir. Perhaps it would have been a happy moment if i had received a tweet from u for a creative reason.Luv&Regards https://t.co/lRWfTYfFQiAjay Devgn’s upcoming film Runway 34 co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Rakul Preet Singh will release on April 29.",2022-04-27

Both the cricketers were isolated from the rest of the team even as Delhi Capitals took to the field and played their games in Mumbai, canceling their travel plans to Pune.Notably, head coach Ricky Ponting also went into 5-day precautionary isolation after one of his family members at the team hotel tested positive for the virus. Ponting got back to the camp on Tuesday and will be travelling with the team for their match against KKR.Ponting was not present at the dug-out for their previous game against Rajasthan Royals which went down the wire.Shedding light on the frustrating time away from the dug-out, Ponting said: ""It's nice to be back outside again. Frustrating (not to travel with the team). I broke 3-4 remote controls.3 or 4 bottles of water might have got thrown into the wall.""When you are on the sidelines being a coach and you can't control what's happening in the middle, that's hard enough. When you are not on the sidelines, and sending text messages every over, saying 'do this, do that, do this'. It got a little more frustrating,"" he told Delhi Capitals after rejoining the camp.Delhi have managed only 3 wins from their first 7 matches and need a change in fortunes in the 2nd half of the season to make it to eh play-offs for the 3rd successive year.",2022-04-27

10,It’s an honour to work with Dale Steyn: Umran Malik ,"Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) cricketer Umran Malik has thanked Dale Steyn for teaching him the tricks of the trade in the fast bowling department. The 22-year-old pacer has breathed fire in the 2022 Indian Premier League (IPL) as he has clocked in excess of 145 km/h on a pretty consistent basis.The Jammu and Kashmir pacer was a tad expensive to start his IPL 2022 sojourn, but has found his rhythm in the tournament. Malik said that he has enjoyed every moment of his interaction with Steyn, who joined the SRH team as the fast bowling coach back in December 2021.“I try to work plans for different batsmen, whether it's slower balls, yorkers or bouncers. Rest is upto God how the plans work or not. The advice (from Steyn) is to have plans and to execute them well. It's an honour to work with a legend like him,” Malik was quoted as saying.Malik, who joined the Sunrisers as a replacement bowler back in 2021, said that he interacts a lot with Bhuvneshwar Kumar, T Natarajan and Marco Jansen to gain more knowledge about the art of pace bowling.“I talk a lot to Bhuvi Bhai (Bhuvneshwar), Nattu (Natarajan) and Jansen. They are all such great bowlers and they help on what to do, and not to do,” he stated.On Wednesday, April 27, the Sunrisers locked horns with the Gujarat Titans (GT) at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Hardik Pandya, the Titans’ skipper, is currently the leading run-scorer for his team in the tournament.Ahead of the match, Malik mentioned that he hasn’t formed any particular tactic for Pandya. “Gameplan is normal (for Hardik), just to keep things simple,” Malik added.Malik joined SRH after Natarajan was tested positive for COVID-19 in the previous edition of the IPL. Thereafter, he played a couple of games, after which the team retained him ahead of the 2022 mega auction along with skipper Kane Williamson and all-rounder Abdul Samad.",2022-04-27

15,"If need be, I will bowl: Hardik cagey about bowling plans after injury scare","Hardik Pandya on Wednesday said he is not going to risk bowling for Gujarat Titans unless and until the need arises, hinting he will use a restrained approach after the injury scare in IPL 2022 last week. Hardik said Gujarat have plenty of bowling options and it's not necessary to push himself.Hardik Pandya began the IPL 2022 season, bowling full tilt for his new franchise. The star all-rounder had headed into the new season as the captain of Gujarat Titans without any competitive action under his belt. Hardik had taken a lengthy break to recover from recurring back injuries after the T20 World Cup in the UAE in 2021.IPL 2022, GT vs SRH Live UpdatesHardik had bowled for Mumbai Indians in IPL 2021 and has not bowled consistently for India over the last 2 years. Questions were asked about his place in the side but the Baroda all-rounder came out all guns blazing, contributing with both bat and ball for Gujarat.However, Hardik missed the game against Chennai Super Kings last week, giving rise to speculation of injury concern. However, he played down any injury issue after coming back to lead Gujarat against Kolkata Knight Riders over the weekend, saying he took a break as a precautionary measure. Notably, Hardik had bowled only 2.3 overs against Rajasthan Royals after hitting a match-winning 87.Asked if he would bowl on Wednesday against SRH, Hardik said: ""I have to see.""""The kind of attack we are playing I can afford to take it easy. If need be, I will bowl, otherwise I will opt out.""Hardik has bowled 111 deliveries in IPL 2022 and has picked up 4 wickets at an impressive economy rate of less than 8 runs per over. Hardik had consistently clocked in excess of 135 kph but the all-rounder wants to be cautious as he gears up for a likely return to the senior national team after impressing in the new season.Hardik, as Gujarat head coach Ashish Nehra said before the tournament, has proved his mettle as a batter, hitting 295 runs in 6 matches, including 3 fifties.",2022-04-27
16,Why Ajay Devgn's Tezz tezi se flopped. On Wahiyat Wednesday,"Ajay Devgn, Anil Kapoor, Priyadarshan - kaash naam ki kaafi hota! The trio was a part of a 2012 disaster titled Tezz, which was an exemplar of how perfect ingredients too can ruin a broth. Ajay Devgn is a Bollywood A-lister and serious roles come easily to him. Understood. But why Tezz? The film had a near-perfect star cast with a pinch of thrill and a dash of good songs - all punched for simmer by Priyadarshan. But Tezz went on to become a disaster in Ajay’s career. So much so, that jis Tezz-i se it hit the screens, usi Tezz-i se it dropped off too. How and why? Read all about it on Wahiyat Wednesday!Tezz is set in the backdrop of the UK, where almost every Indian wears dark-coloured glasses and oftentimes talk in a fake Hindi accent. For instance, take a moment to remember those friends who start pronouncing ‘cool’ as ‘kwel’ a week in America or London. Before we start, let us tell you that Tezz is the loose adaption of 1975 Japanese film, The Bullet Train that went wrong. The movie started with Zayed Khan (yeah, he’s there too but it hardly makes a difference), telling Ajay Devgn (Aakash Rana) how much he was missed. But the face he makes while trying to act! Zayed tries too hard in the first scene that will make you want to scream ‘Bas karo!’ Par ab bol ke kya faeda?Are you waiting for us to tell you about the plot? Let’s do it the other way round, just like the film. Aakash is an illegal immigrant married to a British citizen but is suddenly caught and ousted from the country. Zabardasti! Instead of applying for a VISA and fixing his misdeeds, Aakash feels that the muck he is in isn’t enough and requests the universe for more problems. And that is how vengeance comes to his mind. Wondering how? A bomb threat on a train! A plan is hatched and he knows all the steps to make his master plan a success but suddenly realises, ‘Arre, manpower toh bhool hi gaya!’ And that how Zayed (Aadil) and Sameera Reddy (Megha) get roped in. Never mind, they do a trashy job.Now Aakash’s plan is to threaten police officials (don’t miss the guts) and retrieve money in exchange for information on how to diffuse a bomb on the train. Years and years of police and bomb squad training for nothing!Yes, the only good thing about the film is Malayalam superstar Mohanlal apart from the mere presence of Ajay. What did we previously say about a dish going down the drain in spite of over-perfect ingredients? Yes, the same example applies here too. Mohanlal could have, and was, probably the only cherry on top after Ajay. The South star played a cop who saved passengers from the bombed-up train and had a gripping exit. But could someone offer him a better role, please?Slowly and very slowly, people keep dying one after the other and Aakash is one of the last people left behind. Later, some forced fight sequences and negotiations happen. In fact, it is only towards the end of the film that he gets to know he has a child and gives him a bear hug while the kid looks awkward. But there isn’t much time left for emotions and he has to die in the end (whoops). And some other useless plots later, Aakash dies. He leaves a will-turned-letter for his wife and even before we can gather our thoughts as to hua kya, Priyadarshan’s name flashes on the screen, denoting the film’s end and our wastage of time.Having said that, if you ever feel that you are wasting precious moments of your life, better watch Himmatwala than Tezz. That way you can at least have a laugh, unlike Tezz that leaves you feeling like you’re operating in a vacuum. As if life isn’t enough.",2022-04-27

However, the court has issued notice to all the respondents which is returnable on June 20.Navlani is said to be a close aide of the former Mumbai police commissioner Par Bir Singh, who has not been at good terms with the present Maharashtra government.During the hearing on Wednesday, court asked the Special Investigation Team (SIT) of Mumbai police to place the Preliminary Enquiry (PE) report before them as soon as it is completed.READ | Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Param Bir Singh's aide under IT scannerThe bench of Justices PB Varale and SM Modak said, ""Considering the fact that inquiry was initiated against Navlani, it is expected that respondent state to make a positive statement so far as outcome of inquiry if it reached to its logical end and if it reaches to logical end, Public Prosecutor to place on record copy of the outcome of the inquiry.""Raut had alleged on February 28 that Navlani had extorted a sum of Rs 59 crore in his seven companies from various builders/corporates who were facing investigation by ED. It was also alleged Navlani is a conduit on behalf of the officers of the agency who collects money from the corporates investigated by the agency to settle the matters. A little later, Shiv Sena leader Arvind Bhosle filed a complaint alleging that Navlani was a recovery agent of the ED.On March 8, the Economic Offence Wing of the Mumbai police registered a PE and as soon as SIT was formed, the case was transferred to it.ALSO READ | Income Tax Department targeting Maharashtra government, alleges Sanjay RautNavlani's plea, filed through MZM legal had made 44 respondents including various builders/corporates.

Ponda also submitted that the transactions shown in Navlani's account are all legitimate transactions on which he has paid tax.However, the bench said, ""We can't give interim order.

This is a politically connected matter between the ruling party and an Ex-Commissioner of Police who exposed the shallow and illegal dealing of the persons in power a result of which there has been shaking up the entire state.""The plea further added, ""Even the current SIT is completely biased. They have been misbehaving with the lawyers of Navlani. The persons mentioned in the complaint have not even been summoned by police to date, but Navlani is apprehensive of misbehaviour and coercive action and therefore the present petition has been filed.""",2022-04-27
18,Don’t turn off engine at traffic signals: Bengaluru transport body tells bus drivers amid fire incidents,"The Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) has directed all its Ashok Leyland midi bus drivers not to switch off the engine at traffic signals. This order came after an initial investigation into the cases of buses catching fire, which revealed that the fires originated in the engine.Over the past three months, there have been three incidents where these BMTC buses caught fire. Even though no one was injured in all incidents, a separate committee was formed to investigate the matter.Anbhu Kumar, the Managing Director of BMTC, said, “We have advised the drivers not to switch off and restart the engine at every traffic signal to avoid an electrical shock circuit. Earlier, the engine was switched off to save diesel. Now, we have instructed the drivers to start the bus during the commencement of the trip in bus depots and to only turn it off at the end of the trip.”Addressing the findings of the initial investigation that revealed that the fires would start in the engine, he explained, “The electrical line and diesel line of these buses are next to each other. If there is a case of a diesel leakage, it will lead to a fire.”The order to not turn off engines has been made only as a temporary solution until the full investigation is completed. Ashok Leyland has also been asked to examine all their buses under BMTC.BMTC procured 186 buses from Ashok Leyland in 2014 that were termed as midi buses, being nine meters long and comprising 33 seats, used in the congested areas of the city.READ MORE| Govt ropes in IISc Bangalore to expand probe into electric scooter fire mishaps",2022-04-27

26,Opposition-ruled states hit back at Centre after PM asks them to cut fuel tax,"In his first statement on rising fuel prices in India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took aim at Opposition-ruled states during a meeting on Wednesday afternoon and asked them to reduce taxes.PM Modi said that states like Karnataka and Gujarat reduced Value Added Tax on fuel and passed on the benefits to people, despite the move hurting their treasuries. He added, ""However, states like Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Telangana, Maharashtra, Kerala and Jharkhand did not reduce tax on fuel, and should do it now.""""It has become imperative to increase the coordination between the Centre and the states and uphold the values of cooperative federalism,"" PM Modi said.The Opposition-ruled state governments have not taken very kindly to PM Modi's remarks during the Covid-19 review meet on Wednesday. They have accused him of lying to 'cover his failures', treating non-BJP states with a 'step-mother attitude' and attempting to deflect criticism targeted at the central government.Here is how different state governments have responded:KT Rama Rao, Telangana minister and working president of ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi, took to Twitter to allege that fuel prices had shot up because of the central government.He wrote, ""Name-calling states for not reducing VAT even though we never increased it - is this the co-operative federalism you're talking about Narendra Modi ji? Telangana hasn't increased VAT on fuel since 2014 and rounded off only once.""He added, ""We don't get 41 per cent of our rightful share because of the cess imposed by your government. In the form of cess, you are looting 11.4 per cent from the state and we are getting only 29.6 per cent for FY23. Please scrap cess so we can give petrol at Rs 70 and diesel at Rs 60 all over India. One Nation - One Price?""Fuel prices have shot up because of NPA Central govtName-calling states for not reducing VAT even though we never increased it; is this the co-operative federalism you're talking about @narendramodi ji?#Telangana hasn't increased VAT on fuel since 2014 & rounded off only onceWest Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has said that PM Modi's appeal to Opposition states to reduce fuel tax has a 'political agenda'. Further, she asked the Centre not to 'burden' state governments.She said, ""I ask you, Modi ji, not to talk about these things in a Covid meeting. He [Modi] is telling us to decrease the tax and he will loot the tax. The PM should not speak like this, he cannot burden states like this. He said states should reduce tax but he hiked the price! This is a one-sided remark which is totally misleading.""She said that the West Bengal government had been giving a subsidy of Re 1 on fuel for three years and lost Rs 1,500 crore as a result, but this was not mentioned by PM Modi.""We said share fuel revenue 50-50. But they [Centre] did not agree. They take away 75 per cent. The Centre has earned lakhs of crores on fuel but nothing is shared with the states. The Centre owed Rs 97,000 crore to Bengal - give me that money and we'll give subsidies. It is not true that we don't want to provide relief to the common man but Centre is imposing a huge burden on us,"" she said.Further, Mamata Banerjee alleged that the Centre favoured BJP-ruled states and gave 'step-mother' treatment to others. She said, ""Why should Opposition-ruled states face discrimination and step-mother attitude? This is also one type of extortion. Don't bulldoze democracy and federal structure. You [Modi] gave all the money to BJP-ruled states and not Opposition-ruled ones.""TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh added, ""To cover his failures, he [Modi] has lied and asked states to cut VAT.""A Saravanan, spokesperson of the ruling Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu, said that fuel prices are sky-high due to the Union government's cess.He said, ""Most important aspect is cess doesn't devolve to the state government. We make a counter-proposal to the prime minister. Please don't collect cess and make it VAT - at least the price that you take will devolve to the state governments.""Yet another aspect is the DMK has not raised these prices. We had reduced petrol prices by Rs 3. Also, the VAT prices were set by AIADMK. The PM instead of giving gyan should give VAT to the state. There is no accountability on cess. The Union government has earned Rs 26 lakh crore in last eight years - where has all this gone? The PM is trying to deflect the criticism against him,"" he added.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday that the state government cannot be held responsible for the spike in fuel prices.He said, “Today, in the price of one litre of diesel in Mumbai, Rs 24.38 is for the Centre and Rs 22.37 is for the state. In petrol price, 31.58 paise is central tax and 32.55 paise state tax. Therefore, it is not a fact that petrol and diesel have become more expensive due to the state.”Additionally, Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday that his government had already given citizens tax relief on natural gas.

37,Fact Check: Was Boris Johnson the first British PM to visit Gujarat? News sites fall for faulty info,"Following Boris Johnson’s recent Gujarat visit, many national and international media outlets claimed that he was the first British Prime Minister to visit the western Indian state.Among the ones calling him “the first UK PM to visit Gujarat” were publications like the BBC, The Times of India, and The Economic Times.Industrialist Gautam Adani too amplified this claim. The archived version of his tweet can be seen here.Honoured to host @BorisJohnson, the first UK PM to visit Gujarat, at Adani HQ. Delighted to support climate & sustainability agenda with focus on renewables, green H2 & new energy. Will also work with UK companies to co-create defence & aerospace technologies. #AtmanirbharBharat pic.twitter.com/IzoRpIV6nsThe India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found the claim was untrue. The British High Commission confirmed to India Today that in 1978, then British PM James Callaghan visited Ahmedabad as a guest of then Indian PM Morarji Desai.It is noteworthy that when we checked the official website of the UK government, we found the claim that Johnson was the first British PM to visit Gujarat there as well. This was later fixed.As we began investigating the viral claim when we found a tweet by the Ahmedabad-based historian Patrick French where he pointed out that former PM Morarji Desai had received then UK PM James Callaghan in Ahmedabad in 1978.The press are saying this is the first visit by a UK PM to Gujarat, how could they forget that Morarji Desai took Jim Callaghan to Ahmedabad in 1978. pic.twitter.com/U5sN4m9zg4A New York Times report from January 8, 1978, stated that Callaghan was scheduled to travel with Desai to Gujarat.Johnson stated in his official statement post the India tour that he was the first Conservative British Prime Minister to visit Gujarat.He said, “My friend, Prime Minister Modi, Narendra, my khaas dost — is the phrase I wanted in Hindi. We’ve had a fantastic two days in India. And yesterday I became the first Conservative British Prime Minister to visit Gujarat, your birthplace, of course, Narendra, but, as you just said, the ancestral home of around half of all British Indians.”Additionally, while speaking with Channel 4, when the interviewer said, “You’re the first Prime Minister to”, Johnson interrupted him and finished the sentence: “Come to Gujarat since 1978. How about that? I bet you weren’t gonna say that.”Correction made in the British government websiteAs we mentioned earlier, the official website of the UK government stated that Johnson was the first British PM to visit Gujarat. When we contacted the British High Commission about this, it confirmed to India Today that in 1978, former Prime Minister James Callaghan visited Ahmedabad as a guest of the then Indian PM Morarji Desai.Subsequently, the High Commission corrected the information given on the website from, “This will be the first time a UK Prime Minister has visited Gujarat,” to “This will be the first time a UK Prime Minister from the Conservative Party has visited Gujarat.”Thus, we concluded that the claim of Boris Johnson being the first British PM to visit Gujarat was totally false.(With inputs from Yash Mittal)The number of crows determines the intensity of the lie.",2022-04-27

There were very few fire service personnel and they were overworked. That’s why we pitched in. We assisted hospital personnel who were trying to carry those who were stranded, especially those who couldn’t walk, out of the hospital.”He added, “The fire service, which did a commendable job, was trying to put out the fire in the front. When we went to the backside, we saw nearly 70 people were stranded on top of the building in the harsh heat. We noticed that since it was an old building, they couldn’t find an emergency exit. So, us media people who had gone to report tried to help move them to the shade. Later, large cranes were brought by the state government to rescue them.”",2022-04-27
41,Does Congress have a Plan B after the Prashant Kishor fiasco?,"The Congress's failure to team up with poll strategist Prashant Kishor would go down as a case of missed opportunity or a ‘historic blunder.’What is more troubling for the grand old party is the absence of a ‘plan B’ to streamline the leadership issue and preparations for the 2024 general elections. There are nearly 12 state assembly polls lined up before 2024 including Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh, where the party is in power.The internal disquiet in Rajasthan, the rise of the Aam Aadmi Party in states like Gujarat and uncertain fortunes in Karnataka, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh etc., make the Congress under the Gandhis far more vulnerable.There is also speculation over G 23 renewing their agitation or convening a workers' meeting to force the leadership issue.ALSO READ | Prashant Kishor, Congress walk their separate ways | RecapThe prospects of Rahul Gandhi returning as the 87th AICC chief for the 2022-27 term remain ambiguous. The Congress organisational polls are due in August 2022 but Rahul is yet to make up his mind. If he contests the Congress’ presidential polls, his victory [perhaps unanimous] would be a foregone conclusion, but electoral performance in Gujarat, Karnataka, Telangana etc., may further erode his credibility within the Congress Parivar.If the Gandhis decide to prop up a non-Gandhi as leader of the Congress, the gesture would be seen as taking a leaf from Kishor’s recommendation. In fact, the public display of Kishor’s reported suggestions, prescriptions etc., has the potential to haunt Congress for a long time, as the party may get criticism for opting for his measures without giving credit.There is already a lot of speculation that talks with Kishor fell through because party bigwigs were opposed to giving him a free hand or a fancy designation or access to the party’s coffers [yes you read it right :) it is still something to be sought after!].ALSO READ | The PK-Congress deal: What went wrong | Inside storyIt is significant to note that, unlike a narrative perpetuated by a section of media, Kishor was not rejected by the grand old party on the grounds of the tactician’s ideology [rather the lack of it] or his professional dealings with the Indian Political Action Committee [I-PAC].Kishor was offered a place in the Congress and a membership in the high-profile ‘Empowered Action Group’ tasked to strategise for the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. If there was any doubt about his integrity or association with I-PAC, the offer to join the Congress would not have been made in the first place.AICC general secretary and media department head Randeep Surjewala’s tweet bears testimony to it when he wrote, “Following a presentation & discussions with Sh. Prashant Kishor, Congress President, has constituted an Empowered Action Group 2024 & invited him to join the party as part of the group with defined responsibility.”The confrontation seems to be on his role and mandate where Kishor’s perception or expectations differed with the Congress high command. Kishor, in his presentation, had made a strong case for organisational revamp, settling of the leadership issue and the issue of forging alliances, the Congress focusing on 370 Lok Sabha seats etc.ALSO READ | Prashant Kishor declines Congress offer, won't join partyInterestingly, Kishor was approached by the Gandhis and not the party organisation. It is an open secret that the Gandhi trio Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka - carry enough political heft to push through anything they wish for. A classical case being Rahul’s 2019 election slogan, “chowkidar chor hai” which was not discussed or deliberated upon by any party fora.Post elections, Rahul had gone on record expressing his disappointment with party leaders’ failure to amplify the 'chowkidar Chor hai’ slogan.This was for the third time that the Congress and Kishor have tried establishing functional ties.In 2017, Kishor tried organising the Congress campaign in Uttar Pradesh. The outcome was disastrous.However, the Gandhis continued to talk to him. Throughout 2021, Kishor had a series of meetings with Sonia Gandhi where he harped on the theme of a major organisational overhaul, institutionalisation of ticket distribution system, poll alliances, fundraising etc.On his part, Kishor kept meeting a number of disgruntled party leaders known as G-23, AICC office bearers, regional satraps, and young guns directly. Sonia Gandhi then appointed a three-member committee comprising A K Antony, Mallikarjun Kharge, Ambika Soni to explore the possibility of his involvement with the Congress.A member of the panel had then told this columnist that a number of middle-rung and younger leaders had backed the move to draft Kishor but there were “muted voices” that the grand old party should not be seen as outsourcing its political activities to the new entrant.So, subject to Prashant Kishore getting a 'free hand,' PK focusing on 2024, leading the Congress charge, had been on ‘active consideration’ for over a year.On April 16, 2022, talks between Kishor and Sonia resumed. Just as it looked like the two sides were serious about forging a broad-based opposition alliance against BJP-NDA, some Congress leaders started expressing reservations on the grounds that a ‘free hand’, outsourcing political campaigns etc., may bring ‘bad optics.’Sonia Gandhi, having gone a bit too far, fell upon her favourite penchant -- committee raj. Acting on the advice of A K Antony, Digvijaya Singh and others, she proposed a 17-member empowered Action Group with Kishor as a member with a condition that he should formally join the party.In Kishor’s scheme of things, perhaps it was a case of too little. The tactician, having worked with many politicians, possibly viewed direct access to the top leadership as more functional than hierarchical or as a status symbol. If there is a next time, Kishor would need a full-fledged orientation ‘course’ in Congress’ palace intrigue, internal dynamics and politicking.",2022-04-27

People who have served over 20 years are released. We are also offering you an escape route. Your argument that the Governor does not have the jurisdiction to take a decision on the mercy plea under Article 161 strikes a blow on the federal structure of the Constitution. Under which provision can the Governor refer the decision of the State Cabinet to the President?The bench further added, “If at all the Governor disagrees with the State Cabinet decision to release him, the proper course for him would be to refer it back to the Cabinet and not forward it to the President, who is bound by the aid and advice of the Centre. That cannot simply be done. We prima facie find the Governor’s action wrong and you are arguing against the Constitution.”“Under what provision in the Constitution is the Governor referring the case to the President? Is this not an issue in which the Governor acts on the aid and advice of the State Cabinet? What is the source of power which allows him to refer the matter to the President?

45,What is H3N8 bird flu whose first human case was reported in China?,"While the world witnessed another surge in the Covid-19 cases, a new development from China is set to raise alert levels across the world. China's central province of Henan has reported the first human infection of the H3N8 strain of bird flu.While the risk of its spread among people is being pegged low, according to Chinese authorities, the H3N8 is common in horses and dogs and has even been found in seals. No human cases have so far been found anywhere else in the world. China's National Health Commission has said that the variant was found in a four-year-old boy who showed fever and other symptoms.H3N8 is a type of canine influenza, which is also known as dog flu. According to the US-based Centre for Disease Prevention & Control (CDC), canine influenza A(H3N2) viruses are different from seasonal influenza A(H3N2) viruses that spread annually in people.H3N8 viruses originated in horses and then transmitted to dogs. ""H3N8 equine influenza (horse flu) viruses have been known to exist in horses for more than 40 years,"" CDC maintains. Scientists have said that the virus jumped from horses to dogs for survival and has adapted to cause illness in dogs and spread among dogs, especially those housed in kennels and shelters.Meanwhile, the Canine influenza H3N2 virus originated in birds, is transmitted to dogs, and can now spread between dogs.The first cases of canine influenza from H3N8 were reported in 2004 as it emerged in greyhounds in the United States.So far, there have been no other reports of the virus jumping on to humans from animals. The report from China is the first case of such an event. According to Reuters, the child had been in contact with chickens and crows raised at his home. Whole-genome sequence analyses indicate that the H3N8 virus in this human case is a reassortant, with genes from viruses that have been detected previously in poultry and wild birds.The health commission has said an initial study showed the variant did not yet have the ability to effectively infect humans, and the risk of a large-scale epidemic was low.",2022-04-27

50,OPINION | Startup Challenges: Is it the VC who should be hung?,"In the last few months, we have seen startups being embroiled in corporate governance issues, typically involving their founders. We have seen promising startups such as BharatPe, Zilingo, Infra.market, Trell etc. running into problems of corporate governance. This comes in the backdrop of India having blazed from being almost nowhere in the global startup pecking order about seven years ago to becoming the 3rd largest ecosystem for start-ups in the world, right behind US and China. India now has over 61,400 start-ups, with over 95 of them having achieved 'unicorn' status. That is, they have a valuation of over USD 1 billion.This is stupendous growth for any economy, and it has been possible to a large extent because of the venture capitalists or VC's providing unflinching financial backing to these hordes of startups. Unlike banks or traditional providers of capital for an enterprise, Venture Capitalists (VC's) do not take any collateral and bet their money on the founding team and their idea. It involves a lot of risks and, hopefully, a very significant return that justifies the risk. So in the success of the startups, lies the success of the VC's.ALSO READ | It’s time to regulate regulations in India to boost startups | OPINIONTo understand the issue, one has to understand the business of a Venture Capitalist. Being a VC is expensive. A typical VC firm would require a certain number of people to be on their team in order to sift through the various investment opportunities, do the due diligence and eventually make the investment, adhering to a host of local regulations and ensuring that the investee companies sign on to adhere to the law of the land and to uphold the interests of the investors. In order to support such a large internal team and to keep its overall risks low, a VC typically breaks its total investments into a large number of smaller investments and invests in multiple startups. This also means that the VC's would be extremely challenged in providing oversight to each company, as the companies themselves go through break-neck growth, fuelled by the idea, the entrepreneurial spirit, the market and the backing of the VC capital.ALSO READ | The gaming of warfare | OPINIONIn such a context, is it really fair to zero-in on the VC's for breaches in corporate governance of these fast-growing startups? If the leadership of the startups do not bring up the issues to the board, or the auditors are not able to catch a break in the pattern in the accounts as the startups are new and do not really have much of a history to detect a pattern and are by definition, creating a new sub-industry that does not have precedences to fall back upon, is it realistically feasible for VC's, whose core expertise is to fund startups and not to run startups, to be able to catch slippages in corporate governance? It does seem to be a herculean task.If we look at this issue from the context of traditional corporates, is it justified to hold banks responsible for the failure of large corporates such as Enron or Arthur Andersen or Satyam etc? The job of the banks is to fund the corporates. They sometimes also get a board seat which helps them ensure that their investments are safe. But does it mean that the banks are solely responsible for the failure of these corporate bodies? Clearly no. There are many other factors that lead to slippages in corporate governance staying undetected, and having a board seat does not ensure that one is able to detect such slippages.Indian corporates as a whole seem to be having a large number of cases of inappropriate corporate governance. This is probably the right time to bring in fundamental changes in the oversight of companies and to strengthen them in order to propel India into the top three economies by the end of this decade. However, it would be unwise to shoot the funder, the banker or the VC who helps in providing the fuel to the entrepreneurial energies of this country, for issues that they may not be responsible for.",2022-04-27

64,‘State govt can’t be blamed for spike in fuel price’: Maha CM responds to PM Modi,"After PM Modi appealed to states ruled by non-BJP parties to reduce tax on fuel at a meeting on Wednesday afternoon, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray hit back and said that the state government cannot be held responsible for the spike in fuel prices.He said, “Today, in the price of one litre of diesel in Mumbai, Rs 24.38 is for the Centre and Rs 22.37 is for the state. In petrol price, 31.58 paise is central tax and 32.55 paise state tax. Therefore, it is not a fact that petrol and diesel have become more expensive due to the state.”The Office of the Chief Minister added, “Maharashtra collects the highest GST of 15 per cent in the country. Combining both direct taxes and GST, Maharashtra is the number one state in the country.”In his concluding remarks at a meeting with chief ministers to review the Covid-19 situation in India, PM Modi focused on the issue of rise in fuel price.He said prices were higher in many opposition-ruled states and urged them to reduce Value Added Tax in ""national interest"" to benefit the common man.“I am not criticising anyone but am praying to you for the welfare of people of your states...I urge you to reduce VAT now even after a delay of six months to benefit people,"" he said.As per sources, reduction of VAT on fuel may be discussed at a Maharashtra cabinet meeting on Thursday.Additionally, Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday that his government had already given citizens tax relief on natural gas.In order to promote the use of natural gas, the rate of value added tax has been reduced from 13.5 per cent to 3 per cent, he said. He added that piped gas holders and public transport had benefited.“Under various tax laws, the amount of arrears up to Rs 10,000 per year has been waived off. Benefit has been given to nearly 1 lakh small traders. Traders who have arrears of Rs 10 lakh have been given the option to pay 20 per cent of the total arrears. This will benefit the middle traders in more than two lakh cases,” he said.The Maharashtra CM also said that the facility to pay arrears in installments or one time in case of arrears of Rs 50 lakh has been given.“0.1 per cent stamp duty on gold and silver imported in the state has been waived. Exemption from tax for three years to passengers, pets, vehicles, goods, etc. traveling on ferry boats, ro-ro boats on the waterways starting from January 1, 2022 within the limits of the Maritime Board has been given to promote shipping in the state,” he added.Uddhav Thackeray also accused the Centre of giving 'step-motherly treatment' to the state and not treating all states equally.Maharashtra's Leader of Opposition and BJP member Devendra Fadnavis took to Twitter to respond to Uddhav Thackeray's statements.He said, ""Blame game is safe and good for hiding misdeeds but it doesn’t give relief to the common man. When Govt of India reduced excise duty on fuel prices last November,it also requested States to reduce taxes, but non-BJP ruled states including Maharashtra are busy only in profiting at the cost of sufferings of citizens.""Blame game is safe and good for hiding misdeeds but it doesn’t give relief to the common man.When Govt of India reduced excise duty on fuel prices last November,it also requested States to reduce taxes, but non-BJP ruled states including #Maharashtra are busy only in profiting.. pic.twitter.com/LfjcmOUcnGHe added, ""As our Hon PM Narendra Modi ji appealed all States to reduce taxes on fuel and as Maharashtra already has earned more than Rs 3,400 crore profit, it is my SINCERE REQUEST to CM and Govt of Maharashtra to act immediately and give relief to all Maharashtrians.""",2022-04-27
65,Karachi bombing: Why there is huge Baloch pushback against China-Pak corridor,"A burqa-clad Baloch woman suicide bomber killed four people, including three Chinese nationals (tutors), in an attack on a minibus carrying staff from China-built Confucius Institute at Karachi University on Tuesday.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) has claimed responsibility for the attack, the first major one this year against nationals of all-weather ally China working in Pakistan. BLA, banned in Pakistan for ""terror activities"", said it was their first suicide attack by a woman assailant.While the Karachi suicide bombing is part of an intensifying Baloch pushback against the $54 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), it also spotlights the larger and deeper struggle for Balochistan’s freedom.Let’s first understand Balochistan. Rich in natural resources, it’s Pakistan’s largest but also poorest province, with Quetta as its capital. On March 27, 1948 (observed as Black Day by Baloch people), a newborn Pakistan annexed the Baloch state, marking the beginning of a long-running insurgency.ALSO READ | 3 Chinese nationals killed as mother of two blows up van outside Karachi UniversityOver the years, thousands of people have gone missing in Balochistan, coinciding with a military-led brutal crackdown, often drawing international condemnation. Hundreds of bodies of political activists and suspected armed separatists have been found in the restive province, global media has reported, pointing to extrajudicial killings by Pakistani security agencies.The insurgency is fuelled by the exploitation of resources and oppression of people, but Pakistan, in denial, blames it on India and Iran, a charge both nations have vehemently rejected.BLA is the most prominent group fighting for Balochistan’s independence. Shari Baloch, the 30-year-old suicide bomber in Tuesday’s attack, had joined the ""special self-sacrifice squad"" of BLA’s Majeed Brigade two years ago.A senior leader of the Balochistan freedom movement, Prof Naela Quadri Baloch, who is in exile in Canada, has said that a Government of Balochistan in Exile (GBE) has been established. On the other hand, it's China that’s emerged as a crucial player in Balochistan.China had long been interested in Balochistan’s copper, gold, gas and coal deposits. In 2015, China announced CPEC, an infrastructure network linking a port in Balochistan’s Gwadar to China's western Xinjiang region. Both the regions -- Xinjiang in China and Balochistan in Pakistan -- are restive and have seen military crackdowns by their national governments.ALSO READ | A mother of 2 and wife of a doctor, Karachi suicide bomber held a master's degreePart of China’s global development strategy Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), CPEC includes plans to build road, rail and oil pipeline links as Beijing looks to expand its clout over Central and South Asia and counter American and Indian influence.Thousands of Chinese personnel are working in Pakistan on CPEC projects, many of them being built in Balochistan where separatists say Islamabad is exploiting local resources to help Beijing expand its clout. CPEC has also drawn India's objection.India has repeatedly objected to CPEC passing through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and asked both Pakistan and China not to alter the status quo in areas illegally occupied by Pakistan. India has said Jammu & Kashmir as well as Ladakh have been, are and will always remain integral and inalienable parts of India.Be that as it may, BLA and other separatists from Balochistan have regularly attacked Chinese targets. Tuesday's was only the latest in a string of such cases. Sample some recent incidents.But why is there this massive pushback against the Chinese? Baloch separatists have been angry against mining and energy projects in the region. They say there are no benefits for them as most new jobs have gone to outsiders while locals, already battling crushing poverty, are being pushed off their land.BLA has said that it had warned China several times to “refrain from looting Baloch resources. However, China continues to be involved in its expansionist designs in Balochistan.”“Targeting director and officials of the Confucius Institute, the symbol of Chinese economic, cultural and political expansionism, was to give a clear message to China that its direct or indirect presence in Balochistan will not be tolerated,” BLA has said.The Confucius Institutes are a significant Chinese push for soft power across countries but have often been branded as China’s propaganda mission, also around how Pakistan treats Balochistan.The massive Baloch pushback against the CPEC is part of the larger struggle for Balochistan’s freedom, BLA has said.BLA has said that it had warned China several times to “refrain from aiding Pakistan militarily and financially in carrying out Baloch genocide, but to no avail.”BLA has said Shari was a member of the Baloch Students’ Organisation and was aware of Baloch genocide and occupation of Balochistan.After Tuesday’s attack, Pakistani authorities scrambled to appease China. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has mourned the death of “Chinese friends”, “strongly condemned the heinous and cowardly act of terrorism” and promised action against “the perpetrators.”Pakistan's foreign ministry called the suicide blast ""a direct attack on Pakistan-China friendship"". China has said the blood of the Chinese cannot be shed in vain, demanded severe punishment for the attackers and asked Pakistan to do everything possible to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects in Pakistan.On the other hand, BLA has threatened bigger attacks on Chinese nationals and China’s interests in Balochistan and elsewhere in Pakistan.BLA has asked China to immediately halt its “exploitation projects” and refrain from aiding “the occupying Pakistani state” as “hundreds of highly trained BLA members are ready to carry out deadly attacks.” BLA also asked Pakistan to withdraw from Balochistan, “recognising its independence”.So what comes next? Tuesday’s attack is a crucial challenge for the new Pakistan government, installed after weeks of political turmoil that saw Imran Khan’s ouster as Pakistan’s prime minister, at a time when the Pakistan-Afghanistan border is already on fire.Given the confrontational posturing of Pakistan, China and BLA, the coming days may see more blood in Balochistan and beyond. Pakistan can no longer regard the Baloch insurgency as a low-intensity conflict.",2022-04-27

69,Palm oil export ban by Indonesia begins tomorrow | All you need to know,"Indonesia, the world's top palm oil producer, will ban exports of refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) palm olein, which are made by crushing palm fruit and processing it to remove impurities. The ban is set to begin on Thursday.President Joko Widodo announced the ban on Friday to help lower soaring domestic prices.Palm oil is used in everything from cakes, chocolate, margarine and frying fats to cosmetics, soap, shampoo and cleaning products.Small palm oil planters in Indonesia have enjoyed big paycheques in the past year as global vegetable oil prices surged, but these farmers fear they will bear the brunt of the pain from a new export ban coming into effect on Thursday.Local farmers said prices of fresh palm fruit bunches have already plunged in Kampar, Riau Province on Sumatra island, Reuters reported.Indonesia's ban on palm oil exports is unlikely to last more than a month as Jakarta has limited infrastructure to store the surplus oil and the country faces mounting pressure from buyers to resume shipments, industry officials in Indonesia were quoted as saying by Reuters.The shock move has lifted prices of all edible oils and sowed confusion and alarm among palm oil exporters and consumers alike.However, the stock market panic subsided after officials told palm oil executives the ban will only apply to exports of refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) palm olein, and would not affect flows of crude palm oil or other forms of derivative products.However, Jakarta will widen the ban ""if there is a shortage of refined palm oil,"" according to a presentation the government gave to companies on Monday. RBD palm olein accounts for around 40% of Indonesia's total exports of palm oil products, according to analysts' estimates.Indonesia meets nearly 50 per cent of the total palm oil requirement in India annually.India consumes 22.5 million tonne of edible oil annually, of which 9-9.5 million tonne is met by domestic supplies and the rest by imports. About 3.5-4 million tonne of palm oil is imported by India annually from Indonesia, as per a PTI report.ALSO READ | Palm oil price to go up? Impact of export ban by Indonesia in India",2022-04-27

She is a tried and tested leader who is respected by all. We shall try our best to see that she becomes the real game-changer in the 2024 election.”Earlier in April, actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha beat BJP’s Agnimitra Paul by more than 3 lakh votes to win in Asansol, a constituency in West Bengal that the TMC has never won before.Speaking on his journey in politics, Shatrughan Sinha told India Today, “I came into politics to fulfil my social obligation.

Crew-4 astronauts will do it in spaceSpaceX on Wednesday launched four astronauts to the Space Station on a mission to conduct science experiments as humans push towards the Moon and plan to journey to Mars in the coming decades. Nasa astronauts Kjell Lindgren, Robert Hines, and Jessica Watkins along with European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti will dock with the flying outpost on Thursday.As part of the mission, the four astronauts will conduct several experiments on the flying laboratory, including an attempt to grow plants without soil. The team will continue the work by the Crew-3 mission, which will hand over the experiment already underway to the new team.After docking with the Space Station on Thursday, the four-member crew will engage in a series of scientific experiments that include hydroponic (liquid-based) and aeroponic (air-based) techniques to grow plants without soil. Dubbed XROOTS, the team will use video and still images to evaluate plant growth throughout the entire life cycle.""Current space-based plant systems are small and use particulate media-based systems to deliver water and nutrients. These do not scale up well in space due to mass, containment, maintenance, and sanitation issues. Hydroponic and aeroponic techniques could enable the production of crops on a larger scale for future space exploration,"" Nasa said in a statement.Crew-4 will also be involved with the Protein-Based Artificial Retina Manufacturing experiment that aims at evaluating a manufacturing process to develop artificial human retinas using a light-activated protein called bacteriorhodopsin, which could replace the function of damaged light-sensing cells in the eye. If tested successfully, this could lead to millions on Earth getting vision using AI.The astronauts will also be working on Kibo Robot Programming Challenge that allows students to create programs to control Astrobee, a free-flying robot aboard the International Space Station. To test the technology, students have written software to use multiple free-flying satellites to construct 3D models of a target object. ""The ability to create such models of unknown objects in space using one or two small satellites has potential applications for a wide range of space missions,"" Nasa has said.Medical studies have been one of the biggest focuses for astronauts in space as they bid to ensure a healthy lifestyle for crews that will take to Moon and Mars in the future. The Crew-4 will continue the tradition as they demonstrate tests using a modified, commercial off-the-shelf device to diagnose certain medical conditions. The experiment named rHEALTH uses flow cytometry, a method using lasers to sort and identify cells, and can analyze cell count and cell characteristics; detect microorganisms, biomarkers, and proteins; and diagnose health disorders such as blood cancers.The experiments on board the flying outpost are set to enhance human understanding and not just create the technology for tomorrow but aid humans on Earth as well.",2022-04-27

112,Why did Ajay Devgn hop onto the director's seat with Runway 34 after Shivaay? Actor explains,"Just two days left for the release of Runway 34, and director-actor Ajay Devgn is anxious for his dream project to hit the screens. Runway 34 is a thriller, which stars Ajay, Amitabh Bachchan, Rakul Preet Singh, Boman Irani, Angira Dhar, Aakanksha Singh. For the unaware, the film has been directed by Ajay himself. During an interview with IndiaToday.in, the superstar shared the reason for hopping onto the director's seat after Shivaay.Runway 34 is set to release in theatres on April 29 and Ajay is anxious, already. The Bollywood superstar exclusively told IndiaToday.in about the release jitters he’s been feeling. He said, ""I don't know what I'm feeling right now because I have been just running from pillar to post to finish the post-production. So once the release comes closer, then I'll start feeling something. Having said that, there is a certain kind of nervousness, not butterflies, but you're anxious more than nervous that you want to know what the result is. Because you work so hard and feel a certain way that the film should perform, at least appreciation-wise. So that anxiousness is there to know 'ab kya hoga'.""Ajay's last directorial was Shivaay (2016) and now, after more than six years, the Tanhaji actor jumped onto the directorial’ s seat again. Reasoning it out, Ajay shared, ""I was too occupied for a couple of years. Also, I was producing films, so I had to give a lot to that. Last was Tanahji (2020). Then during the pandemic, we started working on the script and that's the time I really got to work on a script properly, design, and make it. So it was just that because there was time for me and I got a fabulous idea and a great script. It is inspired by a true incident and then we took it forward, worked on the script and it shaped up so well that I thought should be made immediately.""The film is inspired by the true event of the Jet Airways Doha to Kochi flight 9W 555, which had a narrow escape on August 18, 2015, after facing difficulties landing at the Cochin International Airport due to bad weather. Did Ajay know about the incident before working on the film? ""No, not really. I knew about the incident but I didn't know the details of the incident. So when somebody came to me about the incident and when I read about it, it sounded very exciting. It is very interesting and more than that I loved the characters in the film,” he said.A post shared by Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn)Ajay Devgn will play the role of Captain Vikrant Khanna in Runway 34. Speaking about the real-life persona, the actor said, ""This man also is brilliant, he has got a great mind. He is fab at his job. But he is somewhere a rule breaker. So he's somewhere grey. He likes to do things on his own terms and conditions and that is a change for him. So the whole film has got a little bit of a mystery that, what he did? Is he doing it out of arrogance? Or did he do it right? Did it fall in place or it was just by chance? So all that part was very interesting for me.""Runway 34 releases on April 29.",2022-04-27

While some of these vehicles are trundling on the surface of Mars, others are cruising towards asteroids, orbiting the Moon, and even trying to go into interstellar space, escaping the solar system.Eight space missions launched by Nasa got a booster after Nasa evaluated their scientific productivity and potential to deepen our knowledge and understanding of the solar system and beyond.These missions include Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity Rover), InSight lander, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, OSIRIS-REx, and New Horizons. While most of these missions have got renewed life for three years, the OSIRIS-REx has been given a nine-year extension and InSight will be continued until the end of 2022.“Extended missions provide us with the opportunity to leverage NASA’s large investments in exploration, allowing continued science operations at a cost far lower than developing a new mission,"" Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA said in a statement.The eight missions that have been given a new life include:OSIRIS-APEX: The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx), which is currently on its way to Earth after picking up core samples from asteroid Bennu, will keep on pushing. After coming close to Earth, it will deploy the sample case and head on to its new target, Apophis, an asteroid roughly 1,200 feet (roughly 370 meters) in diameter that will come within 32,000 kilometers of Earth in 2029. The spacecraft will study changes in the asteroid caused by its close flyby of Earth and use the spacecraft’s gas thrusters to attempt to dislodge and study the dust and small rocks on and below Apophis’ surface.MAVEN: The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission is planning to study the interaction between Mars’ atmosphere and magnetic field during the upcoming solar maximum. According to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, its observations as the Sun’s activity level increases toward the maximum of its 11-year cycle will deepen our understanding of how Mars’ upper atmosphere and magnetic field interact with the Sun.InSight: Breathing its final breaths on Mars, the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and Heat Transport (InSight) mission will keep providing its services till the end of 2022. It will continue seismic and weather monitoring if the spacecraft remains healthy. The spacecraft, which is on the Martian surface has been suffering due to dust accumulation, which is killing it by blocking the sunlight from reaching the solar panels.LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER: Hovering around the Moon, JPL said that LRO will continue to study the surface and geology of Earth's natural satellite. The extension of services will allow it to study new regions away from the poles in unprecedented detail, including the Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the poles where water ice may be found.MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY: The Mars Science Laboratory and its Curiosity rover have driven more than 16 miles (27 km) on the surface of Mars. Now, it will climb to higher elevations, exploring the critical sulfate-bearing layers that give unique insights into the history of water on Mars.NEW HORIZONS: The mission flew past Pluto in 2015 and the Kuiper Belt object (KBO) Arrokoth in 2019. Now that its mission has been extended for the second time, New Horizons will continue to explore the distant solar system out to 63 astronomical units (AU) from Earth.MARS ODYSSEY: The Odyssey orbiter is providing unique support for real-time data relay from other Mars spacecraft. It will perform new thermal studies of rocks and ice below Mars’ surface, monitor the radiation environment, and continue its long-running climate monitoring campaign.MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER: MRO will study the evolution of Mars’ surface, ices, active geology, and atmosphere and climate. In addition, MRO will continue to provide important data relay service to other Mars missions.Currently, Nasa is operating 14 spacecraft across the solar system and has about 12 missions in the formulation and implementation phase with space agencies from different countries.

We are in favour of a common civil code,” he had said.WATCH | Now, Himachal Pradesh CM Jairam Thakur bats for Uniform Civil CodeGeneral Secretary of AIMPLB Hazrat Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani said, “The Constitution of India allows every citizen to lead a life according to his religion, and it has been included in the Fundamental Rights. Under this right, different personal laws have been kept for minorities and tribal classes according to their wishes and traditions, which does not cause any harm to the country.”Besides Maurya, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami also said his government was preparing the first draft of a Uniform Civil Code. Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jairam Thakur, too, said that his government will look to implement the Uniform Civil Code in the state.The AIMPLB said that it helps in maintaining mutual unity and mutual trust between the majority and the minority and the “rhetoric of the Uniform Civil Code by the Uttarakhand or Uttar Pradesh governments or the Centre is nothing but an attempt to divert attention from issues like inflation, falling economy, and rising unemployment and to increase the agenda of hatred.”The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has appealed to the government to refrain from such actions.WATCH | Delhi HC bats for Uniform Civil Code, asks Centre to take steps for its implementationThe Uniform Civil Code, which comes under Article 44 of the Constitution of India, proposes to introduce personal laws that would apply to all citizens equally, irrespective of their religion, gender, caste, etc.Article 44 states, “The State shall endeavor to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India”. However, since the article comes under the directive principles of state policy, they are regarded as only guidelines and it is not mandatory to use them.At present, the personal laws of various communities are largely governed by their religion.The Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) 2019 Lok Sabha election manifesto promised the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code if it came to power.",2022-04-27

129,"Sabarmati Ashram redevelopment will preserve Gandhian ethos, Gujarat Govt tells HC amid backlash","The Gujarat government told the High Court that the redevelopment of Sabarmati Ashram would make the place more 'visitor friendly' and preserve the 'Gandhian ethos'. The state government submitted an affidavit dated April 25 in response to the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Tushar Gandhi, great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, who had opposed the redevelopment of the Gandhi ashram.The petitioner had expressed fear that the redevelopment would change the physical structure of Sabarmati Ashram and corrupt its simplicity, which embodied the ideology of Mahatma Gandhi. The petitioner apprehended that the nature of redevelopment and over-sized involvement of government authorities in the conception and execution of the project would make it lose the Gandhian ethos, making it opposite to Gandhian principles.However, the state government refused that the proposed revamp will lose the essence of simplicity and Gandhian ethos.According to the state government, “Merely because the proposed project envisages augmented facilities that are necessary, such as the cafeteria, parking lot, parks, does not mean that it seeks to deviate from the ideology of Gandhiji. The proposed project seeks to make the Gandhi Ashram a more visitor-friendly place It is expected that with the development of the Gandhi Ashram, the number of visitors would increase.""

Nucleobases are nitrogen-containing compounds crucial in forming DNA's characteristic double-helix structure.The study published in the journal Nature Communications states that the researchers identify various pyrimidine nucleobases such as cytosine, uracil, and thymine, and their structural isomers such as isocytosine, imidazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 6-methyluracil. It is to be noted that the DNA is made up of nucleobases called adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), meanwhile, RNA, also uses A, C and G, but swaps out thymine for uracil (U).The researchers examined material from three meteorites - one that fell in 1950 near the town of Murray in the U.S. state of Kentucky, one that fell in 1969 near the town of Murchison in Australia's Victoria state, and one that fell in 2000 near Tagish Lake in Canada's British Columbia province.All three are classified as carbonaceous chondrites, made of rocky material thought to have formed early in the solar system's history.

We are sure you had a lot of fun solving yesterday’s puzzle because of its reference to the popular TV series Money Heist. Today’s word of the day is as easy as it gets. Let’s start with a hint. We use this word when we want to imply something that is displayed.HOW TO PLAY WORDLE?Wordle is a simple word-guessing game and requires the player to guess a five-letter word in six tries. The game is available on a website and you can play it from your mobile as well as laptop or computer. There is a grid and a keyboard on the Wordle website and you can choose your letters from it.To start, you have to type your first five-letter word guess. That forms the top row of the grid. If you get one of the letters correct in the grid, that box will turn green. If the letter that you guessed is in the word but not in the correct box, that space will turn yellow. If the player guesses anything else, the tile’s colour remains unchanged.STRATEGIES TO PLAY WORDLE BETTERTip #1: While playing Wordle, try to use letters that are common. The most common letters in the English language are e, t, a, i, o, n, s, h, and r. Try using these in the first few attempts.Tip #2: Don't waste your attempts on words that have a letter you've already eliminated, or letters in a position that they cannot be in.Tip #3: During your initial attempts, if a letter is marked yellow, it cannot be in the same position in any of the following guesses. It will also not be in any position that has already turned green. This means that you do not have to try all four remaining slots for a yellow letter.Tip #4: Think of words with common letters and give it a shot.WORDLE AND ITS INDIA CONNECTWordle was invented by Josh Wardle, a software engineer from Brooklyn, for his Indian partner, Palak Shah, who loves word games.

170,Elon Musk owns Twitter but will Tesla pay the price?,"Elon Musk is the proud owner of Twitter, but the world's richest person's move to buy the social media platform has so far proved to be a cause of concern for Tesla. The world's most valuable automaker lost $126 billion in value on Tuesday.Tesla's share price fell by 12.18 per cent to $876.42 on the US stock market, Nasdaq, on Tuesday.Tesla is not involved in the Twitter deal, yet the company's shares have been targeted by speculators after Musk declined to disclose publicly where his cash for the acquisition is coming from.Tesla's multi-billion loss in its value came amid investors' apprehensions that Chief Executive Musk may have to sell shares to fund his $21 billion equity contribution to his $44 billion buyout of Twitter.Interestingly, the 12.18 per cent drop in Tesla's shares on Tuesday equated to a $21 billion drop in the value of Musk's stake in the company, the same as the $21 billion in cash he committed to the Twitter deal.Tesla's share plunge came against a challenging backdrop for many technology-related stocks. The Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since December 2020 on Tuesday, as investors worried about slowing global growth and more aggressive rate hikes from the US.Twitter's shares also slid on Tuesday, falling 3.9 per cent to close at $49.68 even though Musk agreed to buy it on Monday for $54.20 per share in cash.The widening spread reflects investor concern that the precipitous decline in Tesla's shares, from which Musk derives the majority of his $239 billion fortune, could lead the world's richest person to have second thoughts about the Twitter deal, according to Reuters.Market experts opined that worries about upcoming stock sales by Musk and the possibility that he is becoming distracted by Twitter weighed on Tesla shares. If Tesla's share price continues to tumble, it would jeopardize his financing, experts said.As part of the Tesla deal, Musk also took out a $12.5 billion margin loan tied to his Tesla stock. He had already borrowed against about half of his Tesla shares.ALSO READ | Elon Musk bought Twitter but who sold it",2022-04-27
171,Major Japan railway now powered only by renewable energy,"Tokyo’s Shibuya is famed for its Scramble Crossing, where crowds of people crisscross the intersection in a scene symbolizing urban Japan’s congestion and anonymity. It may have added another boasting right.Tokyu Railways’ trains running through Shibuya and other stations were switched to power generated only by solar and other renewable sources starting April 1.That means the carbon dioxide emissions of Tokyu’s sprawling network of seven train lines and one tram service now stand at zero, with green energy being used at all its stations, including for vending machines for drinks, security camera screens and lighting.Tokyu, which employs 3,855 people and connects Tokyo with nearby Yokohama, is the first railroad operator in Japan to have achieved that goal. It says the carbon dioxide reduction is equivalent to the annual average emissions of 56,000 Japanese households.Nicholas Little, director of railway education at Michigan State University’s Center for Railway Research and Education, commends Tokyu for promoting renewable energy but stressed the importance of boosting the bottom-line amount of that renewable energy.“I would stress the bigger impacts come from increasing electricity generation from renewable sources,” he said. “The long-term battle is to increase production of renewable electricity and provide the transmission infrastructure to get it to the places of consumption.”The technology used by Tokyu’s trains is among the most ecologically friendly options for railways. The other two options are batteries and hydrogen power.And so is it just a publicity stunt, or is Tokyu moving in the right direction?Ryo Takagi, a professor at Kogakuin University and specialist in electric railway systems, believes the answer isn’t simple because how train technology evolves is complex and depends on many uncertain societal factors.In a nutshell, Tokyu’s efforts are definitely not hurting and are probably better than doing nothing. They show the company is taking up the challenge of promoting clean energy, he said.“But I am not going out of my way to praise it as great,” Takagi said.Bigger gains would come from switching from diesel trains in rural areas to hydrogen powered lines and from switching gas-guzzling cars to electric, he said.Tokyu paid an undisclosed amount to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility behind the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, for certification vouching for its use of renewables, even as Japan continues to use coal and other fossil fuels.“We don’t see this as reaching our goal but just a start,” said Assistant Manager Yoshimasa Kitano at Tokyu’s headquarters, a few minutes’ walk from the Scramble Crossing.Such steps are crucial for Japan, the world’s sixth-biggest carbon emitter, to attain its goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050.Only about 20% of Japan’s electricity comes from renewable sources, according to the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, a Tokyo-based independent non-profit research organization.That lags way behind New Zealand, for instance, where 84% of power used comes from renewable energy sources. New Zealand hopes to make that 100% by 2035.The renewable sources driving Tokyu trains include hydropower, geothermal-power, wind power and solar power, according to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that provides the electricity and tracks its energy sourcing.Tokyu has more than 100 kilometers (64 miles) of railway tracks serving 2.2 million people a day, including commuting “salarymen” and “salarywomen” and schoolchildren in uniforms.Since the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, when a tsunami set off by a massive earthquake sent three reactors into meltdowns, Japan has shut down most of its nuclear plants and ramped up use of coal-fired power plants.The country aims to have 36%-38% of its energy come from renewable sources by 2030, while slashing overall energy use.Tokyu Railways has sought to publicize its effort with posters and YouTube clips.Still, Ryuichi Yagi, who heads his own company that used to make neckties but has switched to wallets appeared surprised to learn he was riding on a “green train.”“I had no idea,” he said.Yagi switched his business because of Japan’s “cool biz” movement. It encourages male office workers to doff their suits for open-necked short-sleeve shirts to conserve energy by keeping air conditioning to a minimum in hot summer months.In a sense, he said, “I lead a very green life.”",2022-04-27

He was already drunk.”“He took some more drinks inside. He was evasive when asked about paying the bill. He kept telling the staff to come 15, 20, 30 minutes later. All this led to an argument (between him and the pub staff). By that time, mall security was alerted. The man, however, settled the bill and was moved out.”The pub staff said that the mall security had beat up the guest.“The mall security came in and beat him up. They had an argument and they slapped him. We didn’t beat him. There was only one man from our staff who slapped him once,” said the staff member in custody. “He was beaten to the floor.
