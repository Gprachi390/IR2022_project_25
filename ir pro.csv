Two of them even managed to reach Virat Kohli and get a selfie with former captain Virat Kohli before the 3 spectators were chased out of the field by security personnel at the venue.Much to the delight of the said fans, Virat Kohli obliged for the selfie.Two of the three fans rushed towards Kohli, who was fielding at slips. The security personnel ran across the ground and acted quickly to evict the pitch invaders from the playing area.The incident happened in the sixth over of the Sri Lankan second innings when Kusal Mendis was taking treatment after being hit by a Mohammed Shami delivery in the final session on Sunday at the iconic venue in Bengaluru.WATCH: PITCH INVASION IN BENGALURUFans entered in the ground to take selfie with #viratkohli #Virat #Kohli #IndvsSL pic.twitter.com/jygYxZhKRRThe security personnel rushed towards the players and, after a bit of jostle, managed to get control of the fans.Kohli is arguably the most popular member of the team in Bengaluru as fans turned up in numbers to watch the former captain return to his Indian Premier League home ground.

2,Delhi: 100 EV charging stations to be operational by June 27,"The Hubble Telescope, which is all set to get a new partner in the James Webb Space Telescope, continues to be the eyes and ears beyond Earth's orbit. The flying observatory has now seen the birth of a star and the cosmic tantrums that follow in the deep universe as it observed an object dubbed HH34 evolve in the vastness of the cosmos.The telescope picked up a stellar tantrum, produced by an extremely young star in the earliest phase of formation, that consists of an incandescent jet of gas traveling at supersonic speeds. As these jets collide with the materials in the region produced from the formation of the star, the shock heats this material and causes it to glow.""The result is the colorfully wispy structures, which astronomers refer to as HerbigHaro objects, billowing across the lower right of this image,"" Nasa said in a statement. These objects are known to evolve and change significantly over just a few years. The object Hubble tracked this time is located 1,250 light-years from Earth in the Orion Nebula, a large region of star formation visible to the unaided eye.The image was captured using Hubble's Wide Field Camera 3 to pave for James Webb Telescope observations. Nasa said that the JWST will be be able to peer into the dusty envelopes surrounding still-forming protostars, revolutionising the study of jets from these young stars.This is not the first time that HH34 has been observed. It was previously captured by Hubble between 1994 and 2007 as part of signposts of star birth. Back then astronomers had observed a long jet of material has burst out of a dark cloud of gas and dust that hid the newly forming star as a massive clump of jet material collided with upstream gas, creating the white bow-shaped shock wave at right.In 2015, the Hubble captured this star in much more detail, when an extremely hot, blue jet of gas was observed punching through the enshrouding dust. Although the jet extended the entire length between the infant star and HH34, only a fraction of it appeared visible. This part of the jet possessed an intricate structure of knots and ripples, thought to be caused by the different outbursts catching up and ramming into each other over time.The European Space Agency in a statement said, ""HH objects exist for a cosmically brief time — typically thousands of years — with changes seen in observations taken only a few years apart.""",2022-03-15
3,"Bombay HC criticises plea filed by BJP MLA, calls it 'politically induced litigations'","From achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 to increase in and equal access to green spaces to improving air quality monitoring, Mumbai has announced many measures in its Climate Action Plan (MCAP) unveiled on Sunday. The city has set a target of achieving total carbon neutrality/net zero emissions by 2050, two decades ahead of the Government of India's promised deadline set at the Glasgow CO Summit in 2021. India has committed to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2070. This makes it the first city in South Asia to set such a timeline, reported Bloomberg.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray dedicated to the people the MCAP and hailed the city for being the first in the country to have such a strategy in place, news agency PTI reported.Speaking on the occasion, Thackeray pitched for sustainable development and said the city's administrators want to provide amenities to the people. However, he also underlined that citizens must lead happy and healthy lives, reported PTI.The MCAP has been devised by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) as part of its commitment towards building a climate-resilient city. The plan has proposed some significant changes to the way Mumbai manages energy, water, air, waste, green spaces and transport for its 19 million residents.The event was also attended by Maharashtra Environment Minister Aaditya Thackeray, Minister of State for Environment Sanjay Bansode and others. Aaditya said that with a strategy (the action plan) now in place for collective implementation, a step has been taken closer to safeguarding the future of the people of Mumbai and that of the planet. “Hereafter, agencies & @mybmc will work on; 1) Low-carbon electricity & climate-resilient infrastructure 2) Zero-emission public transport 3) Decentralised waste management 4) Increase green cover 5) Steps for cleaner air 6) Urban flooding & water management,” Aaditya tweeted.Hereafter agencies & @mybmc will work on;1) Low-carbon electricity & climate-resilient infrastructure2) Zero-emission public transport3) Decentralised waste management4) Increase green cover5) Steps for cleaner air6) Urban flooding & water management pic.twitter.com/riWdaVYTHCCM Thackeray said, ""Till 2050, the forecast is that 80 per cent of Nariman Point in South Mumbai will be underwater if no concrete action is taken. Therefore, this plan comes at a crucial time."" (sic). The plan aims to serve as a 30-year road map for the city to tackle the challenges of climate change by adopting sector-specific mitigation and adaptative strategies.The plan has highlighted risks posed to the city under various categories- coastal erosion, landslides, heat, floods and air pollution. It aims for 'mitigation targets' in both the short and long term in the backdrop of various recent extreme weather disasters such as cyclone Tauktae, untimely rains and urban floods.Aaditya Thackeray said that the goal of the state government is to urge people to take action on climate change at the local level. Targets also include a 30 per cent reduction in greenhouse gas (GHC) emissions by 2030 and 44 per cent reduction by 2040.The civic body carried out a vulnerability assessment and an inventory of GHG and natural green cover with technical support from the World Resources Institute India and the C40 cities network.ALSO READ| Climate change: Construction sector responsible for 37% of carbon emissions, finds UN report-The MCAP highlights decarbonising Mumbai's power grid by using clean fuels and renewable energy.

5,"Have survived Russia of 90s, want war to stop, say citizens of Russia and Ukraine staying in Goa","Eight-year-old Brooklynn Chiles fidgets on the hospital bed as she waits for the nurse at Children’s National Hospital. The white paper beneath her crinkles as she shifts to look at the medical objects in the room. She’s had coronavirus three times, and no one can figure out why.Brooklynn’s lucky, sort of. Each time she has tested positive, she has suffered no obvious symptoms. But her dad, Rodney, caught the virus — possibly from her — when she was positive back in September, and he died from it.Her mom, Danielle, is dreading a next bout, fearing her daughter could become gravely ill even though she’s been vaccinated.“Every time, I think: Am I going to go through this with her, too?” she said, sitting on a plastic chair wedged in the corner. “Is this the moment where I lose everyone?”Among the puzzling outcomes of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 6 million people worldwide since it first emerged in 2019, are the symptoms suffered by children.More than 12.7 million children in the U.S. alone have tested positive for Covid-19 since the pandemic began, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Generally, the virus doesn’t hit kids as severely as adults.But, as with some adults, there are still bizarre outcomes. Some youngsters suffer unexplained symptoms long after the virus is gone, what’s often called long Covid. Others get reinfected. Some seem to recover fine, only to be struck later by a mysterious condition that causes severe organ inflammation.And all that can come on top of grieving for loved ones killed by the virus and other interruptions to a normal childhood.Doctors at Children’s National and multiple other hospitals getting money from the National Institutes of Health are studying the long-term effects of Covid-19 on children.The ultimate goal is to evaluate the impact on children’s overall health and development, both physically and mentally — and tease out how their still-developing immune systems respond to the virus to learn why some fare well and others don’t.Children’s has about 200 kids up to age 21 enrolled in the study for three years and it takes on about two new patients each week. The study involves children who have tested positive and those who have not, such as siblings of sick kids. The subjects range from having no symptoms at all to requiring life support in intensive care. On their first visit, participants get a full day of testing, including an ultrasound of their heart, blood work and lung function testing.Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, who runs the study., said its main purpose is to define the myriad complications that children might get after Covid-19 and how common those complications are.Brooklynn is one study subject. So is 3-year-old Alyssa Carpenter, who has had Covid-19 twice and gets strange fevers that break out unexpectedly, and other unusual symptoms. Her feet sometimes turn bright red and sting with pain. Or she’ll lie down and point her little fingers to her chest and say, “It hurts.”Her parents, Tara and Tyson Carpenter, have two other daughters, 5-year-old Audrey and 9-year-old Hailey, who is on the autism spectrum. As for many parents, the pandemic has been a nightmare of missed school, unproductive work, restrictions and confusion. But on top of all the anxiety so many parents feel lies the concern for their toddler. They don’t know how to help her.“It was just super frustrating,” says Tara Carpenter, who is quick to add that no one’s to blame. “We’re trying to find out answers for our kid and nobody could give us any. And it just was really frustrating.”Alyssa would wail in pain from her red burning feet or whimper quietly. She’d come down with a fever, but suffer no other symptoms and be sent home from school for days, ruining Carpenter’s work week. But then in ballet class, with her pink tights and tutu, she’d seem totally normal.In the past few months, symptoms have started to subside and it’s giving the family some relief.“After the fact, what do we do about this?” asks Tara Carpenter. “We don’t know. We literally don’t know.”For some families in the study, the child suffering from long Covid is the easy one during the hospital visits.One recent day, another family finds that it’s the older sister Charlie who dissolves into tears because she doesn’t want blood drawn while younger sister Lexie, used to being prodded by nurses and doctors, hops up on the table. The family dynamics of Covid-19 are tough: The sibling with the illness may get more attention, which can create problems for the others. Exhausted parents struggle with how to help all their children.In their work-ups, the children receive full medical check-ins. They also receive a full psychological assessment, run by Dr. Linda Herbert.Herbert asks the kids about fatigue, sleep, pain, anxiety, depression and peer relationships. Do they have memory concerns? Are they having a hard time keeping things in their brains?“There’s this constellation of symptoms,” she said. “Some kids are incredibly anxious about getting Covid again.”She said psychological symptoms are among the most common, and it’s not just the kids with Covid-19, it’s their siblings and parents, too.Danielle Chiles feels the stress. She’s a single mother working full time, grieving the loss of her partner and trying not to seem too depressed in front of her daughter. The decision to enroll her daughter Brooklynn in the study was motivated by wanting to draw attention to the need for vaccines, particularly in the Black community.“My baby keeps getting it,” she said. “Can’t the people around us try to protect her?”Brooklynn whimpers when she hears she has to get blood drawn: “Do you have to?”“Yes, baby,” the nurse says. “It’s so we can figure all this out.”“If her daddy was here, he’d take her to Dave & Busters after this,” Chiles says, before lowering her voice so her daughter can’t hear what she’s going to say. Her husband, Rodney Chiles, wasn’t vaccinated.He had qualms, like many do, about the vaccine and was waiting to get it. Shortly after Brooklynn tested positive during the run of the delta variant, he started feeling sick and went downhill fast. Chiles had pre-existing conditions, too, which accelerated his death. He was 42.“And then he called us on a Sunday. He was like, ‘They are about to intubate me because I can’t keep my oxygen up. And I love y’all and Brooklynn, forgive me,’” she said. It was the last time he talked to them before he died.“I’ll tell you what,” Danielle Chiles says. “The only reason I’m still here is because I have a child.”On school days, Chiles picks up Brooklynn from Rocketship Rise Academy Public Charter School in Southeast Washington. They walk hand-in-hand to the car for a short ride before she resumes working for a nonprofit organization.One recent day after school, as Chiles had a Zoom meeting in her bedroom office, Brooklynn munched popcorn and talked about how she and her dad bought a pair of tennis shoes and balloons for her mom last year on Mother’s Day. They forgot her mom’s shoe size and they had to come back home and check the size. She giggles as she tells it.In her room, there’s a big photo of her dad and her, though she usually sleeps in bed with her mom now.“Even though kids aren’t as sick, they are losing,” said Chiles. “They’re losing parents, social lives, entire years. Yes, kids are resilient, but they can’t go on like this. No one is this resilient.”",2022-03-14

14,"Eyes on Gujarat polls, Arvind Kejriwal, Bhagwant Mann to hold rally in Ahmedabad in April","The lull before another storm? The calmness at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting held in New Delhi should not be misconstrued as ""all is well"" in the grand old party. The Gandhis' offer to quit from all posts -- Sonia is All India Congress Committee (AICC) interim chief, while Priyanka Gandhi is AICC general secretary -- may have been mocked and ridiculed by a section of media and Congress baiters, but insiders view it as a clear sign of despondency.Equally helpless appear to be those unhappy with the Gandhis’ style of functioning. The group of dissenters, aka G23, does not have the collective will to part ways with the parent organisation. G23 is, in fact, a curious mix of former union ministers, AICC office bearers and other notables who want a seat on the high table in the Congress. Then there are those looking at the Aam Aadmi Party, the Trinamool Congress and the BJP as their next destination. Some G23 members have a simple ambition to get a Rajya Sabha seat or an office at 24, Akbar Road. A vertical split in the Congress appears unlikely.ALSO READ | Congress says it will implement corrective measures after debacle in state pollsThus, a war of attrition continues. The most agitated would look for a life outside the Congress as the prospects of Rahul Gandhi opting for a long sabbatical are bleak. Also, barring a handful of disgruntled party leaders, there are few takers for Congress ""have beens"" in the AAP, the BJP and the Trinamool Congress.Prashant Kishor, who has pockets of influence among many regional satraps, is reportedly cagey and rather dismissive about internal Congress dynamics. Kishor does not want to compromise his functional ties with the Gandhis. More significantly, he does not view the churning in the Congress impacting the 2024 Lok Sabha polls, enhancing the number of Lok Sabha seats in the Opposition kitty.ALSO READ | Fought as hard as we could, will wait for results: Priyanka Gandhi on UP Exit Poll resultsIn yesterday's CWC meet, out of the 56 present, three known dissenters - Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma and Mukul Wasnik (signatories of a G 23 missive sent in August 2022) -- were greatly outnumbered. The dissenting trio did try to make its point without crossing an imaginary ""Laxman Rekha"" of the party discipline. Equally notable was the measured response from the loyalists who restrained from taunting or isolating Azad-Anand-Mukul. This seems part of a design a seasoned Sonia would not want to be seen as one pushing dissenters out.Here lies the story and possibly a way forward for the party. In gist, the Gandhis, particularly Sonia, have understood the key demand from dissenters that Rahul Gandhi should declare himself as the next party president (organisational polls are scheduled to conclude in September) or stop running the party by proxy. Secondly, the Congress intends to thrash out its ideological dilemmas at a ""chintan shivir"" in April and subsequently at the AICC session in Jaipur. In the intervening period, Sonia Gandhi is expected to constitute various panels and committees where she would supposedly not distinguish between a loyalist and a dissenter.It, however, remains to be seen whether many “bright spots"" in the Congress, namely Sachin Pilot and Shashi Tharoor, would benefit from Sonia's largesse. Also in the spotlight is Priyanka Gandhi's reported desire to carry all Congress factions along.ALSO READ | Why Priyanka Gandhi's 'ladki hoon, lad sakti hoon' pitch fell flat in UP | AnalysisHowever, for the time being, all eyes are on Sonia. Having been toying with the idea of retirement since 2016 (when she turned 70), Sonia is expected to either force Rahul to take a formal post (AICC president) or let a non-Gandhi family member run the party. More substantive areas, such as forcing a change in Rahul's style of functioning or his choice of advisors, issues to flag are beyond her capacity. To the dismay of the dissidents, Sonia seems completely switched off about the nonperformance of Team Rahul Gandhi in overall political management of the party, elections, alliances, resource mobilisation, media handling or perception management.In this sense, the Congress' or Sonia's remedial course appears every bit a dose of homoeopathy where a surgery is required. The G 23 has been left with an uneasy option to either wait for Sonia's ""magnanimity"" or look for a life outside the Congress. Both options are far from attractive.Interestingly, while Rahul remains non-committal about contesting the party's presidential polls, his supporters are confident about his candidature. Rahul, according to them, has appointed his trusted aides or favourites in most states, in the AICC secretariat and all such forums. A non-Gandhi would have little or no freedom to run the party unless he/she is fully backed by the Gandhis or keeps signing on the dotted lines.In the next few days, the Congress is expected to witness some letter writers and Twitter warriors articulating their views. One sore point of dissenters is the concept of ""digital voting"" in the AICC organisational polls. Apparently, there was no discussion or deliberation when the idea of digital voting was introduced. The Congress since 2014 has been critical of the central election commission, but it has no mechanism to hold any free or fair internal polls. Dissenters fear that digital voting could play a crucial role in pushing loyalists, favorites on all key posts at all levels of party hierarchy in the guise of inner-party democracy.",2022-03-14

20,SAD retains Sukhbir Singh Badal as president after back-to-back defeats in Punjab,"The shift to automation and the application of analytics in the recruitment industry has been a major turning point, resulting in a surge in demand for new-age technology. While recruiters have difficulty finding the right match for their vacancies, job seekers are having difficulty finding suitable work.There is a difference between how recruiters search for candidates and how job seekers search for work. The need for streamlining the process of targeting the right candidate has emerged during the pandemic.This has set a new benchmark for recruiters to save costs and attract the highest quality of talent.Employers must adopt data-driven technology and recruiting tactics to locate the top applicants to close the skill gap. Data gives new opportunities for talent acquisition and makes it easier for businesses to choose the best applicants.This information is at the heart of streamlining and enhancing the hiring process. The AI-powered hiring tools use predictive analysis to collect data from employees from various sources such as social media, user search interests and other sites and compare it to position requirements to find the best candidates for a job.Programmatic job advertising plays a critical role in enabling firms to find the best candidate by gathering and analyzing enormous quantities of data from several applicant sources and placing laser-targeted ads for maximized output.This broadens the pool of potential employees for businesses. The rule-based approach provided by this mode of advertising plugs the gaps between employers and potential employees, thereby fostering the best match.Programmatic job advertising employs Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Machine Learning, and Predictive Analytics to target the right audience within the employer-defined budget. Placing job ads accurately is only one component of a larger recruitment strategy.To maximize ROI it is recommended to send job adverts to targeted platforms using programmatic technology than wasting time monitoring the recruitment across hundreds of employment sites.A simple and cost-benefit analysis of programmatic job advertising indicates advantages such as minimizing the time required for hiring, reducing the cost wastage arising from cold-calls and walk-in interviews, providing flexibility, and eliminating the errors arising from human bias in selection.Furthermore, this tool also helps in remote hiring, which has become a prerequisite in today’s disrupted times and encourages diversity and inclusiveness in the talent pool. The data-driven approach enhances the traffic to the website and ensures only the most qualified job-seekers with appropriate attributes are onboarded.In addition, to address the talent shortage, companies may need to complement external hiring with training, up-skilling, and re-skilling people to match the requirements of a particular post through Internal Job Postings and Lateral Hiring.By accumulating data on individuals who have the requisite talents, programmatic job ads technology can assist firms in strengthening employer branding, improving candidate experience, and retargeting potential applicants.(The author is Amitt Sharma, Founder and CEO, Receptix)ALSO READ | Cryptocurrency price latest: Bitcoin falls below $40,000",2022-03-14

23,US warns China against helping Moscow as Russian forces renew efforts to take Kyiv | Top Points,"As the world breathes the first whiffs of normality in over two years, and cities open up with people returning to work and children to schools, China is staring at another spate of lockdowns. Beijing locked down a city of 17.5 million people on Sunday, restricting access by suspending services amid fears of another possible coronavirus outbreak.China, where the first coronavirus cases were detected in late 2019 in the central city of Wuhan, has reported a total of 4,636 deaths on the mainland out of 1,15,466 confirmed cases since the pandemic started. According to Worldometer, China on Monday reported 1436 cases in 24 hours. Its numbers are low compared with some countries, but authorities say they are ready to lock down communities if one case is found.China is yet to say if these cases are from Omicron or whether its stealth variant is fuelling the new surge. The World Health Organisation, which tracks Covid-19 variants, has also not said anything about the emergence of a completely new variant in the region.While China has imposed lockdowns, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Monday there were no current plans to further tighten strict social distancing measures as authorities battle to contain a deepening coronavirus outbreak. Lam said there was limited room to tighten further, with the global financial hub already having put in place the strictest measures since its Covid strategy began in 2020.The lockdown in China has been imposed under its “zero tolerance” strategy, which aims to find and isolate every case. The approach was first introduced at the beginning of the pandemic by the government, which has seen large scale on the spur of moment lockdowns, mass testing, and travel bans.As part of the instant lockdowns and the zero-tolerant policies, residents in these regions have to rely on social services offered by the Chinese government that also includes ration, medical and food deliveries. The lockdown also ensures a complete shutdown of border areas in a bid to keep the cases out and to isolate those who have tested positive.Experts had been hopeful that the country's methods that ensured a safe outbreak-free Olympics could have paved the way for it moving away from the zero-tolerance policy. However, new lockdowns do not show it happening anytime soon.The new Covid restrictions were first imposed on Friday, when the industrial city of Changchun with a population of 9 million was put on lockdown. In Beijing, the public is not allowed to leave and the government has closed schools in Shanghai. In Beijing, where five new cases were reported, part of the Yosemite housing complex in the northeastern district of Shunyi was locked down after an infection was found there.The Shanghai city government, where 22 new cases were reported Saturday, announced schools would switch back to teaching online. Shenzhen, which went under lockdown, will see everyone undergo three rounds of testing after 60 new cases were reported on Sunday. Shenzhen is home to some of China’s most prominent companies, including telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies Ltd., electric car brand BYD Auto, Ping An Insurance, and Tencent Holding, operator of the popular WeChat message service.In Hong Kong, a health official warned the public not to assume the territory’s deadly coronavirus surge was under control as the government reported 190 new fatalities, most of them elderly people, and 32,430 new cases. According to the Associated Press, residents of Cangzhou, south of Beijing, were told to stay home after nine cases were reported there.The lockdowns come in the backdrop of a report showing Daily Covid-19 cases in the southern manufacturing hub of Guangdong province could surge to more than 75,000 if curbs are removed and travel is allowed. According to Reuters, Guangdong, which borders Hong Kong, is on the frontline of a new outbreak fuelled by highly infectious variants like Omicron.The continued implementation of ""non-pharmaceutical interventions"" (NPIs) such as mask mandates, social distancing, and lockdowns will keep infections at a manageable level, a study published by the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CCDC) said.The models showed if the current suppression strategy was maintained, including two-week quarantine for incoming visitors, infections could be kept low even with a 20% recovery in travel.With cases going down across the world, China does not seem to be ready to ease its strategy as it battles coronavirus for the third year in a row.",2022-03-14

26,"Lift plunges 40 floors at south Mumbai high-rise, 1 dead","In five years, 162 ""breach of separation"" incidents have happened, DGCA said. An average of 32 such incidents per year happened in Indian airspace. Breach of separation happens when two aircraft come closer than prescribed mandatory distance.Earlier this year, a news report created panic for frequent fliers when on January 19, senior officials of the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said that a major tragedy was averted over Bengaluru's skies. The report said that two passenger flights of IndiGo airlines nearly collided moments after take-off. The near-mishap, which happened on January 7, was averted after a radar controller saw the impending crisis and took corrective actions. More than 400 lives were at risk.Officials of the DGCA said that the two IndiGo planes were involved in a “breach of separation” at Bengaluru airport. A ""breach of separation"" happens when aircraft cross the minimum mandatory vertical or horizontal distance separating airspace from another aircraft.ALSO READ | Grounded by Covid, regular international flights to resume after 2 years from March 27This particular incident was not recorded in any logbook nor was it reported to the DGCA by the Airports Authority of India (AAI). The aviation controller said that it was probing how the error took place and assured “strictest action” against those found responsible.How frequently do such breaches of separation occur over Indian airspace? Who all were involved in past incidents if any? And what action is or has been taken, if any, against such erring pilots or officials?India Today filed a Right to Information query with the DGCA to seek answers to these questions.ALSO READ | Alliance Air flight skids off runaway in Jabalpur, DGCA orders probeThe DGCA replied stating that it had records for only five years. It said, “As per record retention schedule of DGCA, the incident records are maintained for 5 years period.”The number of Airprox incidents for last five years is as follows:So, as per DGCA records, in the last five years alone, 162 ""breach of separation"" incidents have taken place and that means an average of 32 such incidents per year. If we factor in the pandemic shut down of 2020 the average would be much higher.The aviation controller, however, refused to divulge further details regarding the exact nature of danger involved. In its response, the DGCA said, “The details of Airprox incidents is a safety information which is protected from disclosure under para 17 of CAR Section-1 Series-C Part-I available on DGCA website.""ALSO READ | India to resume international flights from March 27: Jyotiraditya ScindiaIn response to what action has been taken against erring officials, the DGCA said, “Based on the outcome of the investigation, the actions including corrective training, suspension and warning are taken against the involved crew or officials of Air Traffic Management.”The matter of breach of air safety seems to be shielded from public scrutiny and the reasoning possibly lies in the logic of so as to not spread panic. However, this also means that over the years, the near-misses have been hidden from available records. It is still hidden from public knowledge as to what actual corrective measures, if any, have been taken after such incidents.",2022-03-14
27,Will fulfill all promises made to Kashmiri Pandits: Nirmala Sitharaman in Lok Sabha,"Western countries, led by the US, UK and European Union, have imposed a number of sanctions and financial penalties on Russia since it invaded Ukraine on February 24. Additionally, hundreds of international companies have withdrawn their services from the country as a mark of protest.While the intent of these measures is to pressurise Russia into halting its offensive in Ukraine, ordinary Russians are beginning to feel the effect on their daily lives.FOLLOW LIVE UPDATES ON UKRAINE-RUSSIA WARSince Russia invaded Ukraine, the Russian ruble has plummeted. As a result, the prices of essentials have gone up.A BBC report quoted a Moscow resident as saying, ""On February 20, I ordered groceries for 5,500 rubles and now the same basket costs 8,000. The price of milk has almost doubled in the past two weeks.”With people stocking up on essentials, some stores have started restricting the quantity people can buy in one go.Some medicines too are becoming increasingly difficult to find.Meanwhile, the prices of more expensive items like cars, laptops and smartphones have also gone up.As the sanctions kicked in, the Russian government started limiting how much people could withdraw in foreign currency. Ordinary people began lining up at ATMs to withdraw cash as news of the war broke.With the imposition of Western sanctions, Russian businesses are struggling to survive. Their customer base is reducing and their costs are rising as the economy suffers a setback.Additionally, those businesses that employed and served foreigners now cannot pay salaries or receive fees due to frozen transfer networks.As a result of international companies pulling out of Russia, several people have lost their jobs.With Russian authorities banning some social media platforms, ordinary Russians feel less connected with the world and their loved ones who reside elsewhere.""This is a completely new kind of crisis which makes us all feel lost and bewildered. Not just in business but in our own lives.

28,Karnataka hijab row verdict today: All you need to know,"The moment the five states' election results were announced, accusations, blame-game, calls for revaluation and introspection began in the Opposition camp as West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee sought forensic examination of EVMs (electronic voting machines) in Uttar Pradesh.The TMC chief (Mamata Banerjee) has also alleged that the BJP won the UP polls with help from “the election machinery, central agencies and central forces”.After the poll debacle in five states, Congress G-23 leaders (a group that called for more visible, active and accountable leadership in the party) demanded reforms in the Congress during a CWC (Congress Working Committee, a powerful decision-making body in the party) meet, raising serious concerns about plans afoot about the grand old party's designs.ALSO READ | With AAP surge, here’s why BJP may not want a literally Congress-mukt Bharat | OPINIONPreviously, the G-23 leaders had written to party chief Sonia Gandhi in August 2020 calling for sweeping reforms in the party including direct election at various levels.Party leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said there was a need to “seriously introspect, re-examine, re-think” whether the race for political positions was undermining the position of the party to an extent where “we end up helping the cause of our Opposition”.Despite the Congress presenting a new leadership through Charanjit Singh Channi, he being the proverbial son of the soil, the incumbency of nearly five years under Captain Amarinder Singh could not be easily ignored. Hence, Punjab witnessed people voting for the AAP (Aam Aadmi Party) for change.So, where has the Opposition gone wrong? Or, what exactly has the BJP done right to win the mandate of the people?There is a saying that one needs to fight libel with libel, poison with poison.So, has the Congress done enough to fight Goliath or did they fail to showcase some stellar work done on the ground?Past few years we have witnessed serious falsifications of truth and trumped-up rhetoric against the Opposition what could have easily been termed as libel literally meaning to expose a person or opponent to public shame, hatred, disgrace or ridicule or induce an ill-opinion of a person that is not true.Should Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his AAP be taken seriously?A simple message to Kejriwal one needn’t take ownership of the police machinery, a simple tweet to the home ministry to take action when Delhi burned would have cemented his position as a tough chief minister of India’s capital city instead of aspersions being cast that the BJP has essentially replaced themselves with AAP in Punjab by single handedly dismantling the congress.ALSO READ | Party workers want Rahul Gandhi to lead Congress again: Manickam TagoreIt is believed that all anti-BJP votes went to the Samajwadi Party in Uttar Pradesh, despite Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s charisma and ground support. It is obvious that the voters did not want to divide the anti-BJP votes. So, they voted strategically for the Samajwadi Party.The Congress party essentially is a national party where there is a block president in every block in every state of India. Opportunistic, rhetoric, pot-shots from the media asides, it’s the electorate that decides. Let’s just accept that there is an ideological battle in the country. Most regional parties have toed the line with the wait-and-watch approach in the ideological battle between the Left and the Right.One thing that even the most hardened Right-winger will agree upon is that the Congress is one party that will never compromise with the BJP. Naysayers will have their own say on this. Let’s accept it that the grand-old-party needs Rahul Gandhi even more today.Agree that the Congress has taken a hit, and yes, introspection is not what the media paints it to be through public flogging of the party, it has already started its membership drive to elect a new president.Modus operandi, strategy and larger issues are being used to conduct internal elections. At the end of the day, the Congress lost Uttarakhand because of this massive Hindutva narrative.ALSO READ | After massive drubbing in 5 states, G23 battle for all-new Congress intensifiesThe reason Arvind Kejriwal won in Punjab was that he was able to sell his successful strategy of building successful schools and good governance, and that is what the Congress has failed to do showcase its previous successes in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh.All these Opposition parties including the AAP broke ranks with the Congress and sided with the government on scrapping the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370. For the Congress, it was an ideological commitment but for the AAP, it was about sticking to power.We cannot do without the Gandhis. The party will be split apart without the Gandhis. Even mass leaders of the party acknowledge that. Even the G-23 leaders have not asked for a change in the Gandhi leadership, quips Ranajit Mukherjee, the All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary and member the West Bengal Congress.Vivek Srivastava from the Communist Party of India (CPI) tells me that the Punjab AAP is using both the BJP and the Congress. The BJP cadre has worked hard for a Congress-mukt Bharat. If this wolf in sheep’s clothing set-up works, the AAP just might end up being the largest player in the Lok Sabha and the electorate will have AAP in BJP’s blessings.In UP, there are murmurs that the BSP had aligned with the BJP 11 per cent votes were allegedly directly transferred to the BJP.ALSO READ | G23 members demand new Congress chief, seek emergency AICC meetingIn comparison, the SP has done exceptionally in UP ending family strife, drawing huge crowds, and increasing its seat tally. They have alleged poll irregularities questioning why the Election Commission was not handing its candidates their victory certificates. The best decision they took was not to have an alliance with the Congress, but to hold their own sway with smaller parties.In western UP, votes of the farmers did not to go to the Samajwadi Party as the the choice of candidates was faulty. They were all outsiders, who were not accepted by the local cadres.Today, the BJP only fears one force the Congress backed by the Left ideology. The socialist ideology spills over in the textbooks. Nationalisation of banks etc, no matter what the Congress did, they took care that the social interactive relationship with the Left was a self-sustaining unit.Today, the communists are confined to Kerala. It helps to serve the purpose of being the only thriving political party in the country. The BJP feels buoyed if Mamata Banerjee remains in power in West Bengal or if the AAP wins in two states or, if K Chandrashekar Rao wins in Telangana as the sole purpose is to decimate the Congress by playing the game of perception and psychological warfare.To thwart their plans, it is important to tighten one’s reign in the Congress, give a more active role to Young Turks like Kanhaiya Kumar, Jignesh Mevani, Hardik Patel and others.In the end, I will just like to say one thing Opposition of the country, unite.

The underpass would link the Bisrakh-Ghaziabad route directly and facilitate seamless traffic movement between Noida and Greater Noida (west).The Kisan Chowk acts as a crucial link for commuters heading towards Ghaziabad, Meerut and Hapur via Delhi-Meerut Expressway. The stretch remains congested through the day and the condition worsens during the peak morning and evening hours and the presence of multiple apartments has led to a massive growth in vehicule population.

""For them, the name Chelonoidis chathamensis should be assigned to the disappeared species and the living taxon should receive a new name.""Genetic studies of surviving Galapagos tortoises began in 1995 and four years later scientists began studying samples form extinct species.The Galapagos -- whose rich biodiversity inspired Charles Darwin's theory of evolution -- is home to a large variety of flamingos, albatross and cormorants.Ecuador recently extended the marine reserve around the islands by 60,000 square kilometers (23,166 square miles).",2022-03-14

55,Sikhs can now carry Kirpans within airports,"Humans have had an impact on Earth. This impact is now visible in the form of climate change, global warming, rising sea temperatures, and extreme weather events. In research that catalogs over 80,000 plant species, scientists have found that most of them, over 20,000, will go extinct thanks to their minimal usefulness to humans.The study that categorises plant species worldwide finds that on this human-dominated planet, many more species of plants are poised to “lose” rather than “win.” Researchers suggest that In a rapidly changing world, species may tolerate shifting conditions, adapt, or migrate to new habitats. Species that benefit humankind may have an additional advantage of survival.""Those that cannot tolerate, adapt, migrate, or prove useful will be the ultimate losers in the Anthropocene and may become extinct,"" the report states. The findings of the study have been published in a paper in Plants People Planet, classifying a significant portion of plant species as winners or losers.Naturalist Charles Darwin, in his theory of evolution, has proposed that evolution works on the theory of survival of the fittest. This means that individuals in a population, or community, are more likely to survive if they are fit in a genetic sense. The new study working on similar lines indicates that human choices now largely dictate the environmental conditions across much of the globe and, as a result, species of plants and animals can survive or will go extinct.""Species lucky enough to be directly or indirectly aided by human activities are likely to survive and can be thought of as “winners,” while those that are pushed to ecological irrelevance or extinction by those same activities are the ultimate “losers” in evolutionary terms,"" researchers at the Smithsonian said in a statement.Researchers place 86,592 species of vascular plants—a large group of plants that have vascular tissue that transport water, nutrients, and other substances—into the eight categories that describe their prospects for survival. These categories include winners useful to humans and winners not useful to humans, losers useful to humans and losers not useful to humans, and currently neutral species.""The results suggest that currently, many more species are losers than winners and that if the tentative winners and potential losers realize their projected trajectories, losers in the future will continue to greatly outnumber future winners,"" the paper read.John Kress, botany curator emeritus at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History, who led the study said that 86,592 species might sound a large number but it is actually just under 30% of the nearly 300,000 known species of vascular plants. Kress and Krupnick categorized 20,293 species of plants as losers, with the vast majority of those losing species being identified as not useful to humans. By contrast, the researchers found just 6,913 species of winners, with all but 164 of those species having some human use.“Now and in the future, plants have to adapt to the environment humans have created or they will go extinct. Our results suggest that this means the plant communities of the future will be more homogenized than those of today,” Gary Krupnick, head of the museum’s plant conservation unit said in a statement.Changing climate and environmental conditions due to human activities is set to put in motion several triggers that will be highly challenging for plant and animal species to adapt to, hinting at more extinctions in the future to come.",2022-03-14

The Congress did not manage to perform well in any of the five states.At this meeting of the party’s highest executive authority, 52 top Congress leaders, including those from the ‘G23’ group of dissenters, discussed how to revive the grand old party.According to sources, Rahul Gandhi said that the party should have a clear-cut strategy on fighting elections.A party member present at the meeting told India Today, “Rahul ji said we must be clear what our aim is and what we will deliver to the people. We need different strategies for different states. BJP is fighting the elections for vested interests, we are fighting the traditional India way, he said. We should fight as a party not as candidates. We, as Congress party, follow principles of Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Patel and we fight for the nation as a whole, whereas certain political parties are fighting for their specific goals, he said.”Other issues that came up at the meeting were finding alliance partners and communication strategy, among others.According to sources, senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad said at the meet that the Congress party must find alliance partners and fix its alliance strategy. He was seconded by senior leader Mukul Wasnik who added that the party must reach out to like-minded opposition parties.On the other hand, when asked what went wrong in Goa, state in-charge Dinesh Gundu Rao said in an exclusive interview with India Today, “It was TMC and AAP that cut our votes.”Tripura in-charge Ajoy Kumar said, “Whether it’s AAP or TMC, they are B team of BJP. If you see, they attack BJP only when there is an election. Else, at the national level, they don’t speak. Only Rahul Gandhi speaks against BJP. Congress is the only party that takes the BJP head on. But we will correct our mistakes.”The issue of alleged EVM malpractice was raised at the meet by Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge, senior leader Digvijay Singh and Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel.While Kharge said the party should seriously think about these issues, Baghel asked what the next course of action in the matter should be.Booth management was also discussed at the meeting.

73,Yami Gautam supports Vivek Agnihotri's The Kashmir Files,"Holding the Gandhi family responsible for the Congress’ poor performance in the recent Assembly polls, Punjab Lok Congress chief and former Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday hit out at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) for trying to put the blame on him instead.Captain Amarinder Singh resigned as the chief minister of Punjab and quit the Congress party after a fallout with Punjab Congress chief Navjot Sidhu last year. The party then appointed Charanjit Channi as the chief minister and he set up a new party, the Punjab Lok Congress. In the Punjab election, the Aam Aadmi Party won a majority and ousted the Channi-led Congress government. The PLC won zero seats in the election.“The Congress has not only lost in Punjab but also in UP, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur and the Gandhis are entirely to blame for the party’s shameful defeat. The fact is that people across the country have lost faith in the leadership of the Gandhis,” he said.Pointing out that many senior leaders within the party were blaming the infighting in the Punjab Congress and the ‘anti-party’ statements of Navjot Sidhu for the party’s poor performance in Punjab, Amarinder Singh said the Congress was comfortably placed in the state till he was sacked to favour “certain sycophants”.“The party dug its own grave in the border state the day they decided to back an unstable and pompous person like Navjot Sidhu and name a corrupt man like Charanjit Singh Channi as chief minister months before the polls,” he said.Amarinder Singh added, “The Congress leaders who are claiming there was strong anti-incumbency against me conveniently forgot that I won every election for the party since 2017, the last being the civic bodies election in February 2021. These leaders are just sycophants who are trying to shield the family by shifting blame and closing their eyes to the writing on the wall.” He also stated that the Congress had no future under the present setup.Captain Amarinder Singh also said that the real reason for the Congress defeat in Punjab was the failure of the high command to rein in people like Navjot Sidhu who” indulged in tarnishing the image of the party for personal gains”. He said, “In their efforts to discredit me, the party high command joined hands with Navjot and others, and in the process ended up discrediting the party totally.”Captain Amarinder Singh said that though he did not owe any explanation to the Congress party, he had chosen to react just to clarify his position to the people of Punjab, to whom he still felt accountable. The former chief minister said that he had been sending fortnightly reports on his government’s achievements to Congress acting president Sonia Gandhi. “Even three weeks before they sacked me, I had offered to quit but Sonia Gandhi had insisted that I stay and lead the party in 2022 elections,” he said.ALSO READ: An offer to quit, impatient G23 and the Kishor factor: Can Gandhis survive to fight another day?",2022-03-14

75,Pink ball Test: SL captain Dimuth Karunaratne hits 14th Test hundred in Bengaluru,"Covid-19 originated in 2019 in China. How? Nobody knows for sure. It came as a shock to the world in 2020, damaging people's health and world's wealth, disrupting the global supply chain. The world's economy suffered like never before as China had practically become the fulcrum of its conveyer belt.The Xi Jinping regime is still asked why it let the world pay this Covid price. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has, in effect, potentially done the same thing: forcing the world to pay the price of his Ukraine war.While China is the manufacturing hub of the world, Russia and Ukraine are the key suppliers of raw materials that run the worlds of oil, gas energy, metallurgical industries and also microchips and semi-conductors, and also foodgrains and edible oil that feed much of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa.Like the case of China, which faced reciprocal supply embargoes due to health security alarms, the Russia-Ukraine war has halted supplies from Ukraine, led to a ban on purchases from Russia and heightened economic woes of the Covid-rattled world. The impact runs from the energy sector to mobile-internet communications and food.Russia is one of the top three suppliers of fuels - oil and gas. Oil prices, though, dipped a little (going below $110 a barrel) on Sunday, counting on the hopes from peace talks between Russia and Ukraine.Also Read: | Explained: Impact of Omicron variant on global economyCrude oil prices soared after Russia's Ukraine invasion, touching $139 before increased supplies from the US, Venezuela and other major suppliers wrested its northward flight.The US, the UK and much of Europe have either banned the purchase of Russian oil or decided not to buy it. Russia supplies 10-12 barrels of oil to each basket of 100 barrels of oil in the international market. In absolute terms, Russia supplies 45-50 lakh barrels of crude oil every day. In 2020, Russia supplied 12 per cent of the world's oil and about 16 per cent of natural gas for energy.Sanctioning Russian oil is bound to trigger an energy crisis, particularly in the poor and developing economies as they try to recover from the Covid-19 shock. The rising oil prices are a worry for India's economic recovery even though Russia is not among the top suppliers.Also Read: China records nearly 3,400 daily virus cases in worst outbreak in two yearsIndia buys about $1 billion of oil from Russia, though its oil import bill is over $82 billion (for 2021) - a 108 per cent rise from 2020. The Russia-Ukraine war is also an opportunity for India. Russia has proposed to India to buy its oil at a lower price paid in Rupee-Ruble exchange. India is already looking to invest in Russia's oil and gas sector.Russia and Ukraine are called the 'Bread Basket' of Europe. Both Russia and Ukraine are major suppliers of food grains and edible oil to the world. Taken together, they supply about 30 per cent of wheat and 20 per cent of maize.Ukraine is the largest supplier of sunflower oil (one of the main 'refined oils' used in India). Russia is the second-largest supplier of the same. Taken together, Russia and Ukraine produce 60 per cent of sunflower oil, whose prices in the future commodity market have reached a 14-year high.Several countries are dependent on Russian-Ukrainian wheat, maize, and other grains - such as Turkey and Egypt, which meet 70 per cent of their food grain needs from these two countries, or China, which buys most of its maize requirement for its pigs. China is the world's biggest pork producer and also an importer, and one of the top exporters of the meat.The Russia-Ukraine war has disrupted the supplies of food grains, maize and edible oil. If this war goes on for long, it could trigger food worries not only in Europe but also in Africa.Russia is the third-largest supplier of gold to the world market after Australia and China. The gold prices soared to a 19-month high last week due to the Russia-Ukraine war before the peace talks between the two helped bring down prices.India meets most of its gold demand through imports. Experts have warned that the yellow metal rates could go past Rs 55,000 per 10 gram if the Russia-Ukraine conflict is not resolved soon. India, though, buys about half of the gold from Switzerland.Russia is among the top suppliers of industrial metals such as aluminum, copper, platinum, nickel, and steel, among others. Disruption in the supplies of aluminum, copper and nickel is a big worry for car manufacturers. The prices of aluminum and copper have risen by about 30 per cent since January. Nickel has become costlier by over 75 per cent. Nickel is the key metal in making lithium-iron batteries used in vehicles.The semiconductor industry is staring at a supply crisis. More commonly known as chips or microchips, semiconductors are crucial to the making and functioning of computers, smartphones, home appliances, and medical equipment.The world depends a lot on the supply of raw materials for chip-making in the US, Europe and elsewhere. Two raw materials hold the key - neon gas and palladium.Ukraine provides more than 90 per cent of high-grade neon for semiconductors. Russia supplies one-third of the palladium. Additionally, Russia's steel industry is the primary source of neon, a byproduct that is refined in Ukraine for making semiconductors, mostly by American companies.Also Read: | China seeing new surge in cases despite ''zero tolerance''The Russia-Ukraine war and consequent sanctions on Russia by the US and European countries could cause a global microchip shortage crisis. The world saw a similar situation during Crimea's annexation by Russia in 2014. But that crisis was short-lived.A multi-faceted supply disruptions arising from the Russia-Ukraine war are similar to the Covid-triggered breaking up of the supply chain. In both cases, the obvious impact looks time-limited, while the economic impact could be long-term.Recent reports from the UK based on information sought under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suggest that the country possibly over-counted its Covid-19 deaths - 17,371 compared to 1.37 lakh officially recorded. Similar readjustments are being done in the US and some European countries.However, the economic impact of Covid-19 is yet to be ascertained before it can be subjected to 'adjustment'. Putin's Ukraine war could bring a similar economic cost to Russia and the rest of the world - deaths and damage counted in Ukraine versus long-term dents to the world economy.Also Read: |Cuba tourism industry gets hit as Russians rush home amid Ukraine crisis.

92,50-year-old woman killed after car rams into bike near Vadipatti in TN’s Madurai | Watch VIDEO,"Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues. Amid all the strategic, geopolitical and humanitarian concerns, there has been a lot of talk about rising crude oil prices and their impact. The impact is on all of us, down to you and also Chadha ji in your neighbourhood.There are many interlinked aspects of this situation. It’s a complex web of factors at work where the lines of cause and effect are often blurred. Let’s try to unpack some of the most fundamental ones.Why is the conflict causing global crude oil prices to rise?Crude oil prices had been rising even during the build-up of Russia’s President Vladimir Putin’s special military operation in the Soviet-era constituent, Ukraine, backed externally by the US-dominated military alliance called Nato (North Atlantic Treaty Organization).This was because the world feared the war would lead the West to ban Russian oil. Even before the US and the UK banned Russian oil and gas imports, some countries had halted their purchases, while others went into panic-buying. Prices soared to a 14-year high of $140 a barrel on March 7. They have come down since then but only slightly.THE RUSSIA FUELRising oil prices leads to the question: Why does Russian fuel matter?Actually, Russia is the world's third-largest oil producer (behind the US and Saudi Arabia). It supplies 14 per cent of global production or 7-8 million barrels per day of crude oil to markets worldwide. The ban by the US and the UK and the decision of some other pro-Ukraine countries not to buy Russian fuel deepen a crisis. The supplies were already tight.By now, we have a fair idea but let’s answer it.At 5.5 million barrels a day, India is the world's third-largest oil consumer, behind the US and China. The oil demand is growing at three-four per cent a year in the country.By this estimate, in a decade, India could be consuming about 7 million barrels a day. India imports 85 per cent of its oil from about 40 countries, the bulk coming from the Middle East and the US.Also Read: | Russia, Ukraine meet for 4th round of talks, tentative hopes for resolutionFrom Russia, India imports 2 per cent of its supplies, including oil which it converts to petroleum products after refining. So, it’s not Russian oil but oil in general and its rising prices that have India worried.We care because there is more mehangai or inflation.High oil prices or supply disruptions will not only mean costlier petrol and diesel for private vehicle owners, but transportation of essential commodities including fruits, vegetables and foodgrains, costs more. And this means more “mehangai”.In January, retail inflation crossed the upper limit of the Reserve Bank of India’s tolerance band of six per cent, for the first time in seven months.India’s worry is linked to the slowing down of the economy.Crude oil trade mostly takes place in US dollars. This means more dollars spent from foreign exchange reserves on oil or, conversely, fewer dollars available for other items of import needed by India.Let’s now talk about you. When you have to spend more on petrol and diesel, you spend less on other items of need. But there also, you hold back spending because of the uptick in inflation. This causes demand for goods and services to go down - activities like construction, manufacturing and import slow.Also Read: | Why Russia-Ukraine war is bad news for post-Covid recovery of world economyCompanies can hire fewer employees. The overall economy takes a hit. This is terrible news, especially given how several economic indicators were improving after the Covid jolt.Its impact is directly on exports and—by extension—on us.India exports petroleum products to more than 100 countries. These products account for more than 13 per cent of India’s total exports. This is also affected by rising crude oil prices. An oil crisis will also impact industries such as petrochemicals and plastics, and power generation, and deepen the jobs crisis.India’s latest Economic Survey has projected 8-8.5 per cent growth for the financial year 2022-23, assuming that oil prices would remain between $70 and $75 a barrel. The Indian crude oil basket price averaged $114.6 a barrel in March, a sharp 22.9 per cent spike from $93.3 a barrel in February.The crude oil price may even surpass its record high of $147.50 a barrel. In fact, Russia has warned that the crude oil price may soar to $300 a barrel if the US and European countries completely ban imports of Russian oil.So, let’s break down these numbers and see what they mean. A downward revision of growth projections means core sectors including agriculture, services and manufacturing won’t do as well as projected.In other words, a reduced workforce and machinery will be needed. The government will have a reduced capacity to spend on infrastructure building and other welfare projects. If the government borrows too heavily to compensate for all this, international agencies may give the country bad ratings. This makes further borrowing trickier. And investment goes down. This deepens the jobs crisis.Oil accounts for about half of India’s excise tax (collected on goods produced within the country) that goes to the central government. States also levy their taxes on sales of petrol and diesel. Reduced revenues will reduce the government’s capacity to spend for you.Don’t be repulsed by one more acronym in your life. CAD is a Current Account Deficit that widens when the total value of goods and services a country imports exceeds the total value of goods and services it exports.Ratings agency ICRA has warned that India’s CAD may widen over three per cent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) because of high oil prices. This hasn’t happened in a decade.According to the latest Reserve Bank of India data, India posted a current account deficit of $9.6 billion or 1.3 per cent of the GDP in the second quarter of 2021-22.In the first quarter of the fiscal year 2021-22, India posted a current account surplus of $6.6 billion or 0.9 per cent of the GDP.But what does a widening CAD really mean?It means reduced foreign exchange reserves that will reduce India’s import capacity, leading to fewer and costlier imported goods in Indian markets. More inflation. Less spending. Reduced demand. Fewer jobs. It’s a vicious cycle. The benefit of a current account deficit is that it allows higher levels of domestic consumption.Why is the Rupee falling?The Rupee falls when foreign portfolio investors pull out money from the stock and bond markets. This time they are doing it because of the global uncertainties caused by the war in Ukraine. Also, the strengthening of the Dollar in line with expectations of better growth in the US economy has pressured the Rupee.There is also a case of causes and lines being blurred here. When imported inflation is pushed up, and current account deficits widen, the Rupee falls. And a falling Rupee pushes up imported inflation and widens current account deficits.The Rupee hit a lifetime low in opening trade on March 7 as the Dollar spiked along with crude oil. Though there has been some recovery since then, the Rupee is likely to remain volatile for some time.What does the falling Rupee mean for you?Importers are hit hard when their Rupee cost per Dollar goes up. They need to shell out more per Dollar to make payments. Costly imports cause local prices to rise. And this is where you’re impacted.The Rupee’s depreciation also spikes domestic fuel prices. That, in turn, makes other essential items expensive as transportation costs rise. A falling Rupee also makes your overseas education and travel costlier because your fees and tickets cost more in line with the Dollar value.On the other hand, a falling Rupee helps exporters receive more rupees in exchange for Dollars. In other words, it gives overseas buyers more purchasing power. But they also have to spend more by way of higher production and processing charges due to expensive imported raw materials like petroleum products, gems and jewellery, electronics and pharmaceuticals.So, oil has become costlier in international markets because Russia invaded Ukraine. But it has also become or is about to become your biggest headache too. The reasons are already explained above. The ways of living in the global village.Also Read: | Sanctions send prices up and businesses down for ordinary Russian people",2022-03-14

95, 1 arrested in Panihati TMC councillor shoot out case in West Bengal,"Environmentalists across the world are unified on the fact that Earth is headed toward a climate emergency where water will become one of the most contested resources globally. In a bid to save natural resources that could then be used in low and middle-income countries, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have developed a new method to save water used in cleaning solar panels across the world.With solar power expected to reach 10 per cent of the global population, an estimated 10 billion gallons of water per year will be used to clean these arrays since most of these solar grids are expected to be set up in desert areas, where sunlight is abundant, where dust can reduce the output of photovoltaic panels by as much as 30 percent in just one month.Researchers at MIT have developed a way of automatically cleaning solar panels in a waterless, no-contact system that could significantly reduce the dust problem. The saved water will be enough to supply drinking water for up to 2 million people, they claim.Researchers used electrostatic repulsion to cause dust particles to detach and rise up the panel’s surface, without the need for water or brushes. To activate the system, a simple electrode passes just above the solar panel’s surface, imparting an electrical charge to the dust particles, which are then repelled by a charge applied to the panel itself, according to a statement by MIT.Published in the journal Science Advances, the research is led by MIT graduate student Sreedath Panat and professor of mechanical engineering Kripa Varanasi. Lab test showed that the drop-off of energy output from the panels happens steeply at the very beginning of the process of dust accumulation and can easily reach a 30 percent reduction after just one month without cleaning. Even a 1 percent reduction in power, for a 150-megawatt solar installation, they calculated, could result in a $200,000 loss in annual revenue.“There is so much work going on in solar materials. They’re pushing the boundaries, trying to gain a few percent here and there in improving the efficiency, and here you have something that can obliterate all of that right away,” Varanasi said in the statement.Researchers estimate that water cleaning makes up to 10 per cent of the operating costs of solar installations and a reduction in these costs could improve the overall power output by allowing for more frequent automated cleanings. “The water footprint of the solar industry is mind-boggling. So, the industry has to be very careful and thoughtful about how to make this a sustainable solution,” Varanasi said.The team added that the new system only requires an electrode, which can be a simple metal bar, to pass over the panel, producing an electric field that imparts a charge to the dust particles as it goes. The team using specially prepared laboratory samples of dust with a range of particle sizes, experiments proved that the process works effectively on a laboratory-scale test installation.“We performed experiments at varying humidities from 5 per cent to 95. As long as the ambient humidity is greater than 30 percent, you can remove almost all of the particles from the surface, but as humidity decreases, it becomes harder,” Panat said. They suggest that each solar panel could be fitted with railings on each side, with an electrode spanning across the panel and the whole process could be automated.",2022-03-14

Chasing 447, Sri Lanka were bowled out for 208 on the third day of the second and the final Test but they will take some pride in Dimuth Karunaratne's fighting 107 and a fine 57 by Kusal Mendis.India had outwitted Sri Lanka in the first Test in Mohali thanks to Ravindra Jadeja's 175 and 9 wickets and Rishabh Pant's 96. In Bengaluru, it was Shreyas Iyer's batting charge, Jasprit Bumrah's searing pace and variation and Pant's ability to strike fear deep in the hearts of spinners that left Sri Lanka rattled. Despite delaying the inevitable on Monday, at no point did Sri Lanka look like even ringing the alarm bells for India.IND vs SL, Pink-ball Test Day 3 HighlightsRohit Sharma relied on his most potent strike bowlers to remove the two well-set Sri Lankan batsmen on what turned out to be the final day of the Test and the series. While R Ashwin got rid of Mendis, Bumrah dismissed Karunaratne as India charged towards their 15th successive Test series win at home.India's bowlers missed the ideal lengths on Monday which allowed Sri Lanka's batsmen to prosper and finally get past the 200-run mark for the first time in the series. The pitch, however, was still extremely tricky for batsmen to survive for long periods and at the end, Bumrah opened the floodgates for an emphatic Indian victory. ! @Paytm #INDvSL pic.twitter.com/Cm6KZg7y0sBUMRAH: 8/47 WITH PINKJasprit Bumrah, who picked up his maiden 5-wicket haul in the first innings, finished with match figures of 8/47, the best bowling figures by an Indian pacer against Sri Lanka in the longest format of the game. He was ably supported by Ashwin, who picked up 4 wickets in the first innings after going past Dale Steyn's all-time tally of 439 Test wickets on Monday.With the victory, Rohit Sharma has completed his 5th successive clean sweep as full-time captain -- a streak that began when India hammered a visiting New Zealand side 3-0 in a T20I series at home last year. Under Rohit, India went on to beat West Indies 3-0 in both the ODI and T20I series earlier this year and outclassed Sri Lanka 3-0.Earlier in the Test, Rishabh Pant scored a quickfire 50 in the 2nd innings while Shreyas Iyer carried on his fine form, hitting 67 as India posted 303/9 in their 2nd innings and set a mammoth target. Captain Rohit got going but the skipper was dismissed for 46 in the 2nd innings while former captain Virat Kohli was undone for 13 by another low-kept delivery.Shreyas Iyer continues to establish himself in the middle-order as he is making the most of the opportunities that have come his way at No. 5 in the absence of Ajinkya Rahane.

120,Delhi: Interstate illegal firearms syndicate busted; 3 arrested,"Aamir Khan is celebrating his 57th birthday today, March 14. The actor, who will soon be seen in Laal Singh Chaddha, the official remake of Hollywood classic Forrest Gump, has done an array of roles in a career spanning almost 33 years. Over the years, the actor has earned the tag of Mr Perfectionist, as he leaves no stone unturned while working on a film. Aamir Khan's first acting stint was as a child actor in Yaadon Ki Baaraat. However, Ketan Mehta's Holi marked in acting debut in Bollywood, followed by Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak.Here's a look at Aamir Khan's Top 10 films:1. Qayamat Se Qayamat TakAamir established himself as a teen heartthrob with his chocolate boy looks in his debut film Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak (1988). The actor was cast opposite Juhi Chawla and fans loved their on-screen chemistry in the film, which was loosely inspired by Romeo and Juliet. The film's music was a huge hit and so were Aamir and Juhi as Raj and Rashmi.2. Jo Jeeta Woh SikandarJo Jeeta Wohi Sikandar can easily be called one of the best teen-sports dramas made in India. The film starred Aamir Khan opposite Ayesha Jhulka and also featured Mamik Singh and Pooja Bedi. It revolved around an inter-college cycling event along with the class divide between the students. Aamir won hearts with his portrayal of Sanju.3. Andaz Apna ApnaOne can't talk about the best Aamir Khan films and miss out on his cult classic Andaz Apna Apna. The actor featured in the film along with Salman Khan, Karisma Kapoor and Raveena Tandon. When the film first released in 1994, it was a flop but over the years, it has gained cult status. Directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, the film has a massive fan following.4. SarfaroshAamir Khan, who was mostly seen in the boy-next-door roles, turned into an action hero in John Matthew Matthan's Sarfarosh (1999), which also starred Naseeruddin Shah, Sonali Bendre and Mukesh Rishi. It revolved around ACP Ajay Singh Rathore's (Aamir) quest to stop cross-border terrorism.5. LagaanAamir Khan's Lagaan was a landmark film. Directed by Ashutosh Gowariker and produced by Aamir, the film was nominated for the Oscars for Best Foreign Language Film and won eight National Film Awards. Set in 1893, in the pre-Independence era, the film revolved around the village of Chamapner and its people who are burdened with high taxes. Things take a turn when a British officer challenges Bhuvan (Aamir) for a cricket match in return for cancelling their tax.6. Dil Chahta HaiThe Farhan Akhtar's directorial debut might have been released in the same year as Lagaan but the two films were poles apart. If Lagaan's Bhuvan was rustic and desi, Dil Chahata Hai's Akash was a witty and carefree urban lad. The film revolved around three friends and the ups and downs in their lives. The film had a stellar cast, amazing music and brilliant camera work.7. Rang De BasantiRakeysh Omprakash Mehra's Rang De Basanti inspired the youth. Along with doing good business, the film also made a social impact. The Aamir Khan-starrer gained popularity for its storyline that depicted both reality and lost patriotism. The film also featured R Madhavan, Siddharth, Soha Ali Khan and Atul Kulkarni, among others.8. Taare Zameen ParAamir Khan turned director with Taare Zameen Par, where he played an art teacher who helps a dyslexic boy overcome his disorder. The film explored the relationship between a teacher and a student and also educated its viewers on dyslexia. Along with brilliant performances and a strong storyline, the film went on to win many awards.9. PKAfter 3 Idiots, Aamir Khan and Rajkumar Hirani collaborated for PK. The film questions people's blind faith in godmen and religious dogmas. The film was a blockbuster hit and shattered many box office records. Aamir played an alien from outer space who gets stuck on earth after he loses the remote control to his spaceship. During his quest to find his remote control he becomes friends with a journalist (Anushka Sharma) who helps him return home. Aamir's quirky character was loved by all.10. DangalDangal saw Aamir Khan's drastic transformation. He played wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat, who trained his daughters Geeta and Babita Phogat who went on to win medals for India in wrestling.

The Chief Justice of the High Court Ritu Raj Awasthi, who is part of the three-judge bench, also asked the parties to give their written submissions within two to three days.The Karnataka hijab row started on January 1 after the management of a government pre-university college in the coastal town of Udupi in Karnataka barred six Muslim girls from attending classes for wearing hijab as the dress was against prescribed norms of the college.This was four days after they requested permission to wear hijab in classes, which was not allowed. Till then, students used to wear the headscarf to the campus, but entered the classroom after removing it, college principal Rudre Gowda had said.""The institution did not have any rule on hijab-wearing since no one used to wear it to the classroom in the last 35 years.

137,Pregnant Kajal Aggarwal flaunts baby bump in latest pics,"In the recently-concluded high voltage assembly elections in five states, the incumbent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won Uttar Pradesh, Goa, Uttarakhand and Manipur, and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) claimed Punjab with a resounding victory. India Today's Data Intelligence Unit (DIU) looked at the profiles of the newly elected assemblies.Of the 690 newly-elected MLAs from the five states, 76 or 11 per cent are women. This is an uptick as compared to the 2017 assembly polls when only 55 or about eight per cent of women participants entered the legislative assembly. This year, women's overall participation was also higher as more women (760) contested as compared to in 2017, when 655 women candidates were in the fray.Punjab observed the highest jump, where the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP decimated the opposition by winning a massive 92 of the 117 assembly seats. Here, 13 women candidates won and entered the state assembly as compared to just six in the 2017 polls.Aside from more women entering the house this time, the number of wealthy candidates who were elected has also increased. Candidates with more than one crore in net assets have risen from 518 (75 per cent) in 2017 to 579 (84 per cent) in 2022. Barring Punjab, the average assets of the winning candidates have also seen a jump.The winning MLAs of Punjab are poorer than their predecessors, with their average assets reduced marginally to Rs. 10.5 crores compared to Rs. 11.8 crores in 2017. On the other hand, the average assets of newly elected members of the Goa assembly have almost doubled to Rs. 20 crores from Rs. 10.9 crores in 2017.Along with money comes muscle power. Looking at the data on the criminal backgrounds of the newly elected representatives, the number of tainted members has increased compared to the previous assembly. Nearly every second MLA elected has declared a criminal case against them. Overall, the number of tainted members has grown to 312 (45 per cent) out of 690. It was 196 (28.4 per cent) in 2017.State-wise, data shows that Manipur has seen a considerable jump in sending such members to the house - the number rose to 14 in 2022 from a mere two in 2017. It is followed by Punjab, where the number of tainted legislators increased from 16 in 2017 to 58 in 2022.Looking at the data of previous elections in Punjab, candidates with criminal records enjoyed only a slim advantage over someone with a clean record. In past elections as well, this has been the trend, as tainted candidates or someone with assets in crores are more likely to win over someone with a clean record or modest wealth. This is especially true for Uttar Pradesh.This time, just like in earlier elections, people preferred more experienced candidates than younger ones. The average age of elected members has increased compared to 2017. Apart from Goa and Punjab, the average age of winning MLAs has increased in Manipur, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand. The oldest lawmakers are from Uttarakhand, where the average age is nearly 56 years.ALSO READ | After bang on exit polls prediction, Axis My India's Pradeep Gupta gets emotionalALSO READ | Exit Polls | Women support, welfarism, caste axis: How Yogi Adityanath trumped Akhilesh Yadav’s Mandal 2.0",2022-03-14

The film has been performing exceptionally well at the box office. The film's director Vivek Agnihotri has become the talking point of The Kashmir Files. Although the film boasts of big names like Anupam Kher, and Mithun Chakraborty, Agnihotri has taken the entire responsibility of the promotion of this film on his shoulders.Today, at a press conference in Delhi, filmmaker Vivek Agnihotri spoke about what went into the making of The Kashmir Files. He said that 5000 hours of research was done and 15 thousand pages of documents were collected to make this film. During the press conference, the director also showed a 20-minute video, which had snippets from the interviews of Kashmiri Pandits who were actually present in Kashmir in those days.Vivek Agnihotri added that he and his wife Pallavi Joshi traveled to many countries around the world and many cities of India to meet Kashmiri Pandit victims and recorded interviews of over 700 victimised Kashmiri Pandits during the making of this film. Agnihotri and Pallavi Joshi were even seen wiping their tears while talking to the victims at various places in this 20-minute video.Agnihotri explains that Kashmiri Pandits are pained because they were thrown out of their house.

He said that the government tried its best to hide this tragedy.The filmmaker further said that many Kashmiri Pandits requested Bollywood bigwigs to make a film on this issue but every time they got disappointed.

He said, ""It was not easy to take this decision, as one has to face many types of dangers, you can be threatened by terrorists and when terrorists attack, no police or army comes to save you, although my wife Pallavi Joshi gave me courage.

147,MP cops to get leave to watch 'The Kashmir Files',"Ever wondered how Ranveer Singh managed to look so different in Ram Leela, Bajirao Mastani, Padmavat and 83? He rocked a messy side-parted hair as he danced to Tattad Tattad in Ram Leela. Then again, he sported a bald look with a dainty ponytail for his portrayal as Bajirao. In the movie 83, he had an uncanny resemblance with Kapil Dev and that subtle yet dense curly hair were just unmissable.And when he played Alauddin Khilji in Padmaavat, he looked unrecognisable with that long, unruly hairstyle! Truly, several people help celebrities to look like they do on the screens. From fashion stylists to makeup artists and hair stylists, there’s a lot that goes behind the scene.Indiatoday.in spoke to one such behind-the-scene hero who can be credited for Ranveer Singh’s versatile and scene-stealing hairstyles he is usually seen sporting, including the ones in the aforementioned movies - Darshan Yewalekar.Darshan is one of the most popular mane men in Bollywood with his clientele ranging from Ranveer Singh and Karan Johar to Ranbir Kapoor, Salman Khan and Saif Ali Khan. He believes in using his hair-styling and designing expertise and extensive research to add essence to each character he works on, instead of just enhancing the glamour.Darshan Yewalekar started his career with a hairstyling course in Bhusawal, Maharashtra where his talent grabbed attention by the man helming the course. He soon moved to Mumbai and with that, began his Bollywood journey. He became a part of Salman Khan’s entourage and then got his first break with Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Saawariya in 2007. With the urge to do something of his own, he opened a salon. But it folded up, and he was left with no money. After years of struggling and being resilient, tables turned when he received a call from Sanjay Leela Bhansali for Goliyon Ki Leela: Ram Leela.Here are excerpts from the interview: “I did Guzaarish for Sanjay Leela Bhansali sir. I designed hair for Aditya Roy Kapoor it was nice, soft curls. After that film, I had no work for two years. I was just living on the edge, figuring out and majorly freelancing. Then suddenly, I got a call from Bhansali sir’s office that we wanted me to design hair for Ranveer Singh. I got a little brief of the subject, the character and the setup of the film and then I did a few sketches. When we met for the first look test for Ranveer Singh, I came up with a few more ideas and showed it to him. He went through all the sketches and really appreciated the work done. He also loved the one which I personally loved the most, and that’s how it happened,” Darshan Yewalekar said.He also revealed that Bhansali gave him complete creative freedom and did not put any restrictions for the hair.RANVEER SINGH’S CONSTANT Darshan has been Ranveer’s go-to person since Ram Leela shooting days. Recalling how it all started, Darshan said, “Within 10 days of Ram Leela, Ranveer was to start with another movie. He called to ask if I would do another film with him, and that’s how their association began. It has been 10 years now that we have been constantly working together.”TRANSFORMATION FOR 83Ranveer Singh wore a wig for 83 that was curated after a lot of research and trials. “We had to do a lot of research on how to do the hair correct. To replicate Kapil sir’s hair, we had to really zoom into the depth and understand every curl. It took us almost 5-6 trials to get the look right. It turned absolutely identical including the moustache and the side locks,” he said.WORKING WITH CELEBS“Everybody is very particular with their hair, how they look and about their craft. But they are also very understanding and open about the ideas. Once they trust you, they know you are coming from a sensible place and give you the freedom. It has never been difficult to work with anybody,” Darshan said.RANVEER’s HAIR SECRETS A post shared by (@darshanyewalekar)Darshan Yewalekar also spilled the beans on how Ranveer Singh keeps his hair healthy. “A good workout routine and proper diet are two very important things to have healthy hair. And Ranveer follows both very strictly,” he said. “For the outer hair health, we give him a particular kind of shampoo and conditioner as per the weather. He also takes spas. Oiling your hair also helps,” he said.HAIRCARE AT HOME Summer is here and so is Holi. So, here are some haircare tips you can consider adding to your routine. “In summers, if your hair gets dry easily, try using a mix of onion oil with coconut oil. You can also directly apply aloe vera gel, straight from the plant,” he added.“As for Holi, don’t forget to oil your skin and hair properly before the celebrations. If you have blonde hair, they will still catch the colour. But apply argan oil so that the colour doesn’t go deep and then visit a salon after a week.”ALSO READ: Ranveer Singh makes a case for androgynous fashion.

148,Greater Noida to get underpass at Kisan Chowk to decongest traffic intersection,"England pacer Jofra Archer is not surprised that his new franchise, Mumbai Indians (MI), have won a record-extending five Indian Premier League (IPL) titles, as he believes close-knit and family-oriented teams always do well. Notably, Archer was bought by Mumbai Indians for a whopping Rs 8 crore despite his unavailability for this year's IPL season.The 26-year-old, who has undergone two surgeries to treat his troubled right elbow, will sit out of the IPL this year as he continues his recovery from the injury. But he's already excited by the prospect of joining the franchise in the future.""MI looks very close-knit and family-oriented and such teams always do well. That's why it is no surprise that we have won five titles,"" Archer told the team's official social media handle.""Polly's (Kieron Pollard) been there 10 years, (Lasith) Malinga was there a long time, the same with Rohit (Sharma) too. These things make you feel safe when you come into the team as a new player,"" Jofra said.The perception of fast bowlers has always been that they are an angry bunch, who need to stoke that fire to generate fearsome pace.However, the Englishman, who has played 42 games across formats besides winning his team a World Cup, said it's about staying calm.""I think you need to be calm as a fast bowler because you have to know when to step it up and when to tone it down,"" he said.""Being calm allows me to just make better decisions. Bowling also doesn't really change much according to conditions, you just have to know when and where to use your variations,"" he added.Having made his Test debut in the 2019 Ashes, where he picked up two fifers, Archer had bowled an unplayable bouncer to Steve Smith. Smith went on to miss the third Test with a concussion.""I mean, I won't call it one of my best deliveries because he still came back and batted in the rest of that series.""For me, the best ball always has to be a wicket-taking delivery, the batter has to be sent back,"" he said, picking the one that got Travis Head's wicket in the fourth Test as his best delivery.""I think the best delivery I have ever bowled came in that series when I knocked back Travis Head's middle stump in the fourth Test.""The previous ball he had just driven me down the ground and I was angry. The next ball I remember getting one back into him and I had a smug look on my face after,"" Archer added.MI will be the second team Archer will play for in the IPL after Rajasthan Royals, where he was part of the team for three seasons. He was released by the Royals after he missed the 2021 season due to his recurring elbow injury.The speedster feels the change will be a great opportunity to see where he stands.""The change of environment is good because you then get to challenge yourself. It is all right to perform in your comfort zone, but when you actually go away and start performing in a different team, in a different setting, only then can you probably start rating yourself,"" he said.""It is like when Cristiano Ronaldo first left England, people said he may not be good outside, but then he has performed and done it wherever he has gone. No one can ever question his skill now. It is pretty much the same concept.Mumbai Indians open their IPL campaign this year against Delhi Capitals on March 27.",2022-03-14

153,OPINION | Congress: Split wide open? ,"After days of protests, counter-protests, allegations, counter-allegations and back-to-back hearings, the Karnataka High Court is set to pronounce its verdict on the hijab case on Tuesday, March 15.On January 1, some Muslim students of pre-university college in Karnataka’s Udupi were not allowed to attend classes wearing a hijab, as the dress was against the prescribed norms of the college. The College Development Committee president, BJP MLA Ragupathi Bhat, said students who are protesting and sitting outside [the campus] are 'free to leave'.""A Transfer Certificate (TC) will be given and they can go to any college that will allow them to do so. But, our policy is clear. No hijabs in the classroom,"" the MLA said. The role of MLAs in CDCs were a point of debate during the high court hearings, with the petitioners challenging the administrative role of the MLAs.READ | No hijab in minority institutions? K'taka govt issues orderOn January 26, the Karnataka government set up an expert committee to resolve the issue. It was announced that all girls should adhere to uniform rules until a committee offers its recommendations.Meanwhile, Udupi students filed a writ petition in the Karnataka High Court seeking a declaration that wearing a hijab is a fundamental right. The plea stated that the Indian constitution guarantees the freedom of conscience and the right to profess, practise and propagate religion.First instances of hijab issue spreading to other colleges were reported on January 3. A section of college students in Karnataka's Koppa district wore saffron scarves protesting against allowing Muslim girls to wear hijab inside the classroom. Similar protests erupted in Mangaluru colleges on January 6.In February, Kundapur college authorities, citing new government guidelines, asked girl students not to come to college wearing hijabs. When the girl students refused, several students came to college wearing saffron shawls. Students in Shivamogga college also protested against hijab in classrooms. Kundapura and Shivamogga were to become the epicentre of pro and anti-hijab protests that were set to follow.Nazila, who was one of the students not allowed to enter the college premises with a hijab, said the Kundapura management pushed the girls and stopped them from entering the college.""There were 28 girls. We asked our principal, but they did not give any answers. They are saying that the rule was introduced by the government. They are not seeing us like students,"" Nazila told India Today, adding that they were admitted to college with hijabs earlier.Karnataka government ordered a ban on clothes that disturb equality, integrity and public order in schools and colleges. The state government invoked 133 (2) of the Karnataka Education Act-1983, which says a uniform style of clothes has to be worn compulsorily. The dress code was chosen by the College Development Committee or the appellate committee of the administrative board of the pre-university colleges, which come under the pre-university education department.On February 8, students wearing saffron scarves raised slogans against Muslim girls donning the hijab at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial College (MGM) in Udupi district. The students wearing saffron scarves raised 'Jai Shri Ram' slogans and confronted the Muslim students. The school authorities intervened to keep both groups of students away from each other.Karnataka High Court began hearing the case, and the faceoff between students for and against hijab reached boiling point. Saffron-clad students prevented Muslim girls from attending classes and the girls refused to budge. A video of a mob chanting 'Jai Shri Ram' accosting a girl outside a college went viral. The girl, in turn, responded with 'Allah-hu-Akbar'.Section 144 was imposed in Shivamogga after incidents of stone-pelting were reported on February 8. Protests in Bagalkot also turned violent after stones were pelted and the police had to resort to lathi-charge. The Karnataka High Court appealed to students and people to maintain peace and tranquility and the government closed all schools and colleges.Pro-hijab protests and rallies were stagged in several places including New Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Malegaon. Muslim women came out in large numbers to show support for students fighting against the hijab ban in schools and colleges in Karnataka.On February 10, the three-judge bench comprising of Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court Ritu Raj Awasthi, Justice Krishna S Dixit, and Justice JM Khazi stated that colleges in Karnataka can reopen but no student can wear anything religious till the matter is pending before the court. Following the interim order, schools and colleges in the state were opened in a phased manner. All colleges were re-opened on February 16.Senior Advocate Sanjay Hegde, appearing for students from Udupi, argued that since December 2021, the petitioners have been facing discrimination in their classes. The students wearing 'hijab' were made to stand out from the class and it continues, said Hegde, adding that the petitioners said the headscarf is part of their religious and cultural practice.Advocate Devadatt Kamat, appearing for students from Kundapura, argued that the petitioners are not refusing to wear uniforms.""They [students wearing hijab] are asking that they be allowed to wear a headscarf of the same color as their uniform. But the state is saying a headscarf is not allowed as part of the uniform,"" Kamat stated.ALSO READ | Muslim girl went for ABVP rally. Read the backstory of Karnataka hijab protestThe petitioners also stated that colleges cannot ban hijabs. Advocate Kamat said, ""To allow the College Development Committee to decide whether to allow students to wear headscarves or not is totally illegal. The only restriction that can be imposed under Article 25 is public order, which can only be imposed by the state. Can a college development committee consisting of an MLA and some subordinates decide on exercising fundamental freedom? How can a statutory authority be made the guardian of our fundamental rights?""Senior advocates Ravi Varma Kumar and Yusuf Muchhala argued that display of religion through attire shows diversity and singling out hijab violates fundamental rights.ALSO READ | From Kemal Pasha's Turkey to Nicolas Sarkozy's France, the row over hijab and burqa""Ghoongats (veils) are permitted, bangles are permitted. Why only hijab?"" asked the petitioners' lawyers as they sought an order allowing Muslim girls to attend classes again wearing hijab.They also alleged that Muslim students are being put to Hobsons' choice - a free choice in which only one thing is actually offered. They said students are being asked to choose between faith and education.Advocate Devadatt Kamat also drew comparisons between the hijab case and judgments made by courts in Turkey, South Africa and the US with respect to religion and religious symbols.Karnataka government contended that hijab is not an essential religious practice of Islam and preventing its use did not violate Article 25 of the Indian Constitution, which guarantees religious freedom. Advocate General Prabhuling Navadgi said that government has taken a stand that wearing hijab is not an essential practice under Islam.Advocate Navadgi said, ""My first submission is that the order is in consonance with the Education Act. Second is the more substantive argument that hijab is an essential part. We have taken the stand that wearing of hijab does not fall within the essential religious practice of Islam. Third is that right to wear hijab can be traced to Article 19 (1) (a). Submission is that it does not do so.""As the hearing went on, the petitioners began seeking some relief to sport the headscarf. The counsel representing the Muslim girls requested the Karnataka High Court to pass an order allowing girls to wear Hijab on Friday, and during the holy month of Ramzan.Advocate Kulkarni contended there was a ""mass hysteria"" in the country due to the Hijab issue. He said Hijab was ""not against health or morality"". According to him, banning Hijab amounted to banning the holy Quran.PU College, which was the epicentre of the Karnataka hijab row told the high court that the Campus Front of India (CFI) was a radical organisation that was spearheading the issue. Counsel for the PU College, senior advocate SS Naganand, said that the uniform was made compulsory by the college in 2004 and there had been no issue until the CFI met some students who wanted to wear hijab to college.He added, “Representatives of the CFI came and met the college authorities saying the students should be allowed to wear hijabs. Only after that, ruckus started happening and students started protesting.”The court also directed the state government to submit any intelligence input on CFI.ALSO READ | Rallies to football matches: How Karnataka hijab row is escalating across India",2022-03-14

178,Mumbai becomes first South Asian city to aim for carbon neutrality by 2050,"After dismissing PILs last week, the Bombay High Court in its detailed order came down heavily on ""politically induced litigations"". The court had dismissed two PILs filed by BJP MLA Girish Mahajan and citizen Janak Vyas, respectively, challenging rules for the election of speaker and deputy speaker of Maharashtra Assembly.In the detailed order, the Bombay High Court said “political rivalries have to be resolved elsewhere other than the courts must be the determining principle for holding whether these PIL petitions involve genuine public interest or whether, at all, Vyas or Mahajan satisfies the test of uberrima fides, which is the first requirement for the maintainability of a public interest litigation,” the order read.The HC last week dismissed the two non-maintainable public interest litigations challenging rules for the election of speaker and deputy speaker of Maharashtra assembly as it found no genuine public interest in the pleas. [Janak Vyas v. State of Maharashtra & connected PIL]In the 36-page order, the court emphasised that public interest jurisdiction of the High Court should not be “politics interest litigation”. The court was of the view that such litigation stops more deserving cases from being heard.Before hearing the case, HC asked Vyas and then Mahajan to deposit Rs 2 lakh and Rs 10 lakh, respectively. Because the Advocate General, representing the Maharashtra government, had stated that he had serious objections to these issues being raised in a PIL.The court later forfeited the amount that had been paid by them. The Bench clarified in the order that the deposits were to be utilised for charitable purposes of providing better facilities and amenities to senior citizens residing in old age homes and destitute and orphan children residing in children's homes and orphanages.",2022-03-14
