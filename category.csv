4,5,Need to put behind idea that others define India: Jaishankar ,"External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said India needs to put behind the idea that it needs to get approval from other nations on how it engages with the world. He said it is better to engage with the world on the basis of ""who we are"" rather than try and please the world.Speaking at an interactive session at the Raisina Dialogue, India's premier foreign policy conference, Jaishankar said, ""We have to be confident about who we are.

We think our choices are best placed to advance that.""Earlier, Jaishankar had spoken on India’s position on the Ukraine war calling it steadfast and consistent. We have expressed deep concern at the worsening situation and called for an immediate cessation of violence and end to all hostilities, he had said.So far, India has not yet publicly condemned the Russian attack on Ukraine and has been calling for the resolution of the conflict through dialogue and diplomacy.Jaishankar said the choices made by India have had a larger influence globally and hoped that India will be ""deeply more international"" in terms of its commitments, responsibilities and roles in the next 25 years.""We should not be looking at the world with a sense of entitlement. We need to earn our place in the world and to a certain extent, therefore, comes to the issue of how the world benefits from the growth of India. We need to demonstrate that,"" he added.The external affairs minister also spoke about India's contribution to the spread of democracy in South Asia.""We would like to see more prosperity in South Asia.

5,6,"Pant right guy to lead India in Tests, he is maturing with age: Yuvraj","Even as the Indian Premier League is dominating headlines, former India all-rounder Yuvraj Singh has opened up about potential captaincy candidates for the Indian Test team. Backing Rishabh Pant, Yuvraj said the wicketkeeper-batter could lead India well in the longest format of the game, while adding that he should be given time with the leadership group.Virat Kohli stepped down as India's Test captain in an unforeseen way after India's loss to South Africa in a 3-match Test series. Rohit Sharma was appointed as his successor but it remains to be seen if the star opener, at 34, will be able to manage the rigiours of leading the team across all formats of the game.Chief selector Chetan Sharma had stressed during Rohit's appointment that it was not a short-term appointment but Yuvraj Singh believes Rishabh Pant needs to be groomed into the role and it's the right time to make him the deputy. Notably, Jasprit Bumrah was named the vice-captain for the 2-match Test series against Sri Lanka before the IPL.Speaking to Sports 18, Yuvraj Singh highlighted that someone like MS Dhoni was thrown into deep water and it might be the right time to give Pant the responsibility.""You must get someone ready. Like Mahi became captain out of nowhere but they made him, right! Then he evolved. Keeper is always a good thinker because he always has the best view on the ground,"" Yuvraj said.""You pick a young guy who can be a future captain, give him time and don't expect miracles in the first six months or a year. I feel you must believe in the younger guys to get the job done,"" he added.Pant was not a certainty in the Indian Test team despite a solid start to his career in whites. However, it all changed after replacing Wriddhiman Saha in the XI following the infamous Adelaide Test in which India were bundled out for 36.Pant played a couple of blinders in Sydney and Brisbane, helping India breach Australia's Gabba fortress and win the series Down Under 2-1.Pant has evolved into a leadership material, having led Delhi Capitals over the last 2 seasons.Meanwhile, Yuvraj hit back at ctitics, saying Pant is getting matured with every passing day and that star cricketers, including him and Virat Kohli, lacked maturity when they had started out.""I was immature at that age, Virat was immature when he was captain at that age. But he (Pant) is maturing with time,"" Yuvraj said.""I don't know how the support staff thinks about it, but I think he is the right guy to lead the Test team.""You already have four Test hundreds already and you can do that.

10,11,‘State govt can’t be blamed for spike in fuel price’: Maha CM responds to PM Modi,"After PM Modi appealed to states ruled by non-BJP parties to reduce tax on fuel at a meeting on Wednesday afternoon, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray hit back and said that the state government cannot be held responsible for the spike in fuel prices.He said, “Today, in the price of one litre of diesel in Mumbai, Rs 24.38 is for the Centre and Rs 22.37 is for the state. In petrol price, 31.58 paise is central tax and 32.55 paise state tax. Therefore, it is not a fact that petrol and diesel have become more expensive due to the state.”The Office of the Chief Minister added, “Maharashtra collects the highest GST of 15 per cent in the country. Combining both direct taxes and GST, Maharashtra is the number one state in the country.”In his concluding remarks at a meeting with chief ministers to review the Covid-19 situation in India, PM Modi focused on the issue of rise in fuel price.He said prices were higher in many opposition-ruled states and urged them to reduce Value Added Tax in ""national interest"" to benefit the common man.“I am not criticising anyone but am praying to you for the welfare of people of your states...I urge you to reduce VAT now even after a delay of six months to benefit people,"" he said.As per sources, reduction of VAT on fuel may be discussed at a Maharashtra cabinet meeting on Thursday.Additionally, Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday that his government had already given citizens tax relief on natural gas.In order to promote the use of natural gas, the rate of value added tax has been reduced from 13.5 per cent to 3 per cent, he said. He added that piped gas holders and public transport had benefited.“Under various tax laws, the amount of arrears up to Rs 10,000 per year has been waived off. Benefit has been given to nearly 1 lakh small traders. Traders who have arrears of Rs 10 lakh have been given the option to pay 20 per cent of the total arrears.

In petrol price, 31.58 paise is central tax and 32.55 paise state tax. Therefore, it is not a fact that petrol and diesel have become more expensive due to the state.”The Office of the Chief Minister added, “Maharashtra collects the highest GST of 15 per cent in the country. Combining both direct taxes and GST, Maharashtra is the number one state in the country.”In his concluding remarks at a meeting with chief ministers to review the Covid-19 situation in India, PM Modi focused on the issue of rise in fuel price.He said prices were higher in many opposition-ruled states and urged them to reduce Value Added Tax in ""national interest"" to benefit the common man.“I am not criticising anyone but am praying to you for the welfare of people of your states...I urge you to reduce VAT now even after a delay of six months to benefit people,"" he said.As per sources, reduction of VAT on fuel may be discussed at a Maharashtra cabinet meeting on Thursday.Additionally, Uddhav Thackeray said on Wednesday that his government had already given citizens tax relief on natural gas.In order to promote the use of natural gas, the rate of value added tax has been reduced from 13.5 per cent to 3 per cent, he said. He added that piped gas holders and public transport had benefited.“Under various tax laws, the amount of arrears up to Rs 10,000 per year has been waived off. Benefit has been given to nearly 1 lakh small traders. Traders who have arrears of Rs 10 lakh have been given the option to pay 20 per cent of the total arrears. This will benefit the middle traders in more than two lakh cases,” he said.The Maharashtra CM also said that the facility to pay arrears in installments or one time in case of arrears of Rs 50 lakh has been given.“0.1 per cent stamp duty on gold and silver imported in the state has been waived.

11,12,Karachi bombing: Why there is huge Baloch pushback against China-Pak corridor,"A burqa-clad Baloch woman suicide bomber killed four people, including three Chinese nationals (tutors), in an attack on a minibus carrying staff from China-built Confucius Institute at Karachi University on Tuesday.The Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) has claimed responsibility for the attack, the first major one this year against nationals of all-weather ally China working in Pakistan. BLA, banned in Pakistan for ""terror activities"", said it was their first suicide attack by a woman assailant.While the Karachi suicide bombing is part of an intensifying Baloch pushback against the $54 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), it also spotlights the larger and deeper struggle for Balochistan’s freedom.Let’s first understand Balochistan. Rich in natural resources, it’s Pakistan’s largest but also poorest province, with Quetta as its capital. On March 27, 1948 (observed as Black Day by Baloch people), a newborn Pakistan annexed the Baloch state, marking the beginning of a long-running insurgency.ALSO READ | 3 Chinese nationals killed as mother of two blows up van outside Karachi UniversityOver the years, thousands of people have gone missing in Balochistan, coinciding with a military-led brutal crackdown, often drawing international condemnation. Hundreds of bodies of political activists and suspected armed separatists have been found in the restive province, global media has reported, pointing to extrajudicial killings by Pakistani security agencies.The insurgency is fuelled by the exploitation of resources and oppression of people, but Pakistan, in denial, blames it on India and Iran, a charge both nations have vehemently rejected.BLA is the most prominent group fighting for Balochistan’s independence. Shari Baloch, the 30-year-old suicide bomber in Tuesday’s attack, had joined the ""special self-sacrifice squad"" of BLA’s Majeed Brigade two years ago.A senior leader of the Balochistan freedom movement, Prof Naela Quadri Baloch, who is in exile in Canada, has said that a Government of Balochistan in Exile (GBE) has been established. On the other hand, it's China that’s emerged as a crucial player in Balochistan.China had long been interested in Balochistan’s copper, gold, gas and coal deposits. In 2015, China announced CPEC, an infrastructure network linking a port in Balochistan’s Gwadar to China's western Xinjiang region. Both the regions -- Xinjiang in China and Balochistan in Pakistan -- are restive and have seen military crackdowns by their national governments.ALSO READ | A mother of 2 and wife of a doctor, Karachi suicide bomber held a master's degreePart of China’s global development strategy Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), CPEC includes plans to build road, rail and oil pipeline links as Beijing looks to expand its clout over Central and South Asia and counter American and Indian influence.Thousands of Chinese personnel are working in Pakistan on CPEC projects, many of them being built in Balochistan where separatists say Islamabad is exploiting local resources to help Beijing expand its clout. CPEC has also drawn India's objection.India has repeatedly objected to CPEC passing through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and asked both Pakistan and China not to alter the status quo in areas illegally occupied by Pakistan. India has said Jammu & Kashmir as well as Ladakh have been, are and will always remain integral and inalienable parts of India.Be that as it may, BLA and other separatists from Balochistan have regularly attacked Chinese targets. Tuesday's was only the latest in a string of such cases. Sample some recent incidents.But why is there this massive pushback against the Chinese? Baloch separatists have been angry against mining and energy projects in the region. They say there are no benefits for them as most new jobs have gone to outsiders while locals, already battling crushing poverty, are being pushed off their land.BLA has said that it had warned China several times to “refrain from looting Baloch resources. However, China continues to be involved in its expansionist designs in Balochistan.”“Targeting director and officials of the Confucius Institute, the symbol of Chinese economic, cultural and political expansionism, was to give a clear message to China that its direct or indirect presence in Balochistan will not be tolerated,” BLA has said.The Confucius Institutes are a significant Chinese push for soft power across countries but have often been branded as China’s propaganda mission, also around how Pakistan treats Balochistan.The massive Baloch pushback against the CPEC is part of the larger struggle for Balochistan’s freedom, BLA has said.BLA has said that it had warned China several times to “refrain from aiding Pakistan militarily and financially in carrying out Baloch genocide, but to no avail.”BLA has said Shari was a member of the Baloch Students’ Organisation and was aware of Baloch genocide and occupation of Balochistan.After Tuesday’s attack, Pakistani authorities scrambled to appease China. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has mourned the death of “Chinese friends”, “strongly condemned the heinous and cowardly act of terrorism” and promised action against “the perpetrators.”Pakistan's foreign ministry called the suicide blast ""a direct attack on Pakistan-China friendship"". China has said the blood of the Chinese cannot be shed in vain, demanded severe punishment for the attackers and asked Pakistan to do everything possible to ensure the safety of Chinese citizens, institutions and projects in Pakistan.On the other hand, BLA has threatened bigger attacks on Chinese nationals and China’s interests in Balochistan and elsewhere in Pakistan.BLA has asked China to immediately halt its “exploitation projects” and refrain from aiding “the occupying Pakistani state” as “hundreds of highly trained BLA members are ready to carry out deadly attacks.” BLA also asked Pakistan to withdraw from Balochistan, “recognising its independence”.So what comes next? Tuesday’s attack is a crucial challenge for the new Pakistan government, installed after weeks of political turmoil that saw Imran Khan’s ouster as Pakistan’s prime minister, at a time when the Pakistan-Afghanistan border is already on fire.Given the confrontational posturing of Pakistan, China and BLA, the coming days may see more blood in Balochistan and beyond.

14,15,Palm oil export ban by Indonesia begins tomorrow | All you need to know,"Indonesia, the world's top palm oil producer, will ban exports of refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) palm olein, which are made by crushing palm fruit and processing it to remove impurities. The ban is set to begin on Thursday.President Joko Widodo announced the ban on Friday to help lower soaring domestic prices.Palm oil is used in everything from cakes, chocolate, margarine and frying fats to cosmetics, soap, shampoo and cleaning products.Small palm oil planters in Indonesia have enjoyed big paycheques in the past year as global vegetable oil prices surged, but these farmers fear they will bear the brunt of the pain from a new export ban coming into effect on Thursday.Local farmers said prices of fresh palm fruit bunches have already plunged in Kampar, Riau Province on Sumatra island, Reuters reported.Indonesia's ban on palm oil exports is unlikely to last more than a month as Jakarta has limited infrastructure to store the surplus oil and the country faces mounting pressure from buyers to resume shipments, industry officials in Indonesia were quoted as saying by Reuters.The shock move has lifted prices of all edible oils and sowed confusion and alarm among palm oil exporters and consumers alike.However, the stock market panic subsided after officials told palm oil executives the ban will only apply to exports of refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) palm olein, and would not affect flows of crude palm oil or other forms of derivative products.However, Jakarta will widen the ban ""if there is a shortage of refined palm oil,"" according to a presentation the government gave to companies on Monday. RBD palm olein accounts for around 40% of Indonesia's total exports of palm oil products, according to analysts' estimates.Indonesia meets nearly 50 per cent of the total palm oil requirement in India annually.India consumes 22.5 million tonne of edible oil annually, of which 9-9.5 million tonne is met by domestic supplies and the rest by imports. About 3.5-4 million tonne of palm oil is imported by India annually from Indonesia, as per a PTI report.ALSO READ | Palm oil price to go up?

26,27,Mamata will be game-changer in 2024 Lok Sabha polls: TMC's Shatrughan Sinha | Exclusive,"In an exclusive conversation with India Today, newly elected MP Shatrughan Sinha said that West Bengal CM and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee is likely to be the “real game-changer” in the 2024 Lok Sabha election.Shatrughan Sinha, who won the Asansol Lok Sabha constituency in the bypoll held earlier this month, said, “I am impressed by the queen of hearts Mamata Banerjee. She is a tried and tested leader who is respected by all. We shall try our best to see that she becomes the real game-changer in the 2024 election.”Earlier in April, actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha beat BJP’s Agnimitra Paul by more than 3 lakh votes to win in Asansol, a constituency in West Bengal that the TMC has never won before.Speaking on his journey in politics, Shatrughan Sinha told India Today, “I came into politics to fulfil my social obligation. I was influenced by Jayprakash Narayan.”Further, he said he left the BJP and joined the All India Trinamool Congress because the saffron party had transformed into an autocracy from a democracy.“Atal Bihari's and LK Advani's BJP was a democratic setup. Today's BJP, which is being run by the prime minister, is an autocracy,” said Shatrughan Sinha, who was a minister in Atal Bihari Vajpayee's cabinet.He added that he had fought his first election because his then mentor LK Advani had told him to.Narrating the story, he said, “I fought my first election against my friend Rajesh Khanna, who was fighting on a Congress ticket, and lost. It was a by-election. I didn't want to fight it but did because my mentor Advani told me to do so. Advani spoke to my wife and asked her to tell me to fight the election.”",2022-04-27,"Mamata will be game-changer in 2024 Lok Sabha polls: TMC's Shatrughan Sinha | ExclusiveIn an exclusive conversation with India Today, newly elected MP Shatrughan Sinha said that West Bengal CM and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee is likely to be the “real game-changer” in the 2024 Lok Sabha election.Shatrughan Sinha, who won the Asansol Lok Sabha constituency in the bypoll held earlier this month, said, “I am impressed by the queen of hearts Mamata Banerjee.

29,30,Broke 3-4 remote controls at hotel room: Ponting on 'frustrating' isolation,"Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting said he is relieved and excited again to be back after completing the 5-day isolation as the team heads into the second half of Indian Premier League 2022. Ponting was forced to miss the match against Delhi Capitals on Friday, April 22 after one of his family members tested positive for Covid-19.Delhi Capitals confirmed that Ricky Ponting tested negative for Covid-19 but he was isolated as a precautionary measure.Recalling the time away from the game, Ponting said it was a frustrating experience, not being able to be on the sidelines and shout instructions to the team when they lost a last-over thriller to the Rajasthan Royals. The Australian tactician said he broke a couple of television remotes at the hotel room, venting out his frustration.""It's nice to be back outside again. Frustrating (not to travel with the team). I broke 3-4 remote controls.3 or 4 bottles of water might have got thrown into the wall,"" Ponting told Delhi Capitals.""When you are on the sidelines being a coach and you can't control what's happening in the middle, that's hard enough. When you are not on the sidelines, and sending text messages every over, saying 'do this, do that, do this'. It got a little more frustrating,"" he added.Delhi Capitals began their campaign well by beating Mumbai Indians but they have lacked the consistency that vaulted them to the play-offs in the last 2 seasons. Delhi have not managed to stich two successive victories even once in the season.Ponting said he thought Delhi would gather a winning run after their dominant 9-wicket win over Punjab Kings on April 20 but they lost to Rajasthan Royals by 15 runs in a high-scorig match.With Ponting not at the dug-out, tempers flared as Rishabh Pant got assistant coach Pravin Amre to storm onto the pitch and contest the on-field umpire's call over waist-high fulltoss during a tense final over.""I've said it a few times this year where there's 36 or 37 overs of really good stuff, and we just let it slip for two or three overs. And, that's the difference in these games,"" Ponting added.""We sort of gear ourselves to not overtrain in the first part of the season, try and build up along the way. But our performances have been win one, lose one, win one. So, we need to start getting that little bit of momentum.""""Our performances have been win one, lose win. After our win against the Kings, I thought the momentum would have been going our away. It didn't happen in the last game.

And if we are, things will definitely change for us.""",2022-04-27,"Broke 3-4 remote controls at hotel room: Ponting on 'frustrating' isolationDelhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting said he is relieved and excited again to be back after completing the 5-day isolation as the team heads into the second half of Indian Premier League 2022. Ponting was forced to miss the match against Delhi Capitals on Friday, April 22 after one of his family members tested positive for Covid-19.Delhi Capitals confirmed that Ricky Ponting tested negative for Covid-19 but he was isolated as a precautionary measure.Recalling the time away from the game, Ponting said it was a frustrating experience, not being able to be on the sidelines and shout instructions to the team when they lost a last-over thriller to the Rajasthan Royals. The Australian tactician said he broke a couple of television remotes at the hotel room, venting out his frustration.""It's nice to be back outside again. Frustrating (not to travel with the team). I broke 3-4 remote controls.3 or 4 bottles of water might have got thrown into the wall,"" Ponting told Delhi Capitals.""When you are on the sidelines being a coach and you can't control what's happening in the middle, that's hard enough. When you are not on the sidelines, and sending text messages every over, saying 'do this, do that, do this'. It got a little more frustrating,"" he added.Delhi Capitals began their campaign well by beating Mumbai Indians but they have lacked the consistency that vaulted them to the play-offs in the last 2 seasons. Delhi have not managed to stich two successive victories even once in the season.Ponting said he thought Delhi would gather a winning run after their dominant 9-wicket win over Punjab Kings on April 20 but they lost to Rajasthan Royals by 15 runs in a high-scorig match.With Ponting not at the dug-out, tempers flared as Rishabh Pant got assistant coach Pravin Amre to storm onto the pitch and contest the on-field umpire's call over waist-high fulltoss during a tense final over.""I've said it a few times this year where there's 36 or 37 overs of really good stuff, and we just let it slip for two or three overs. And, that's the difference in these games,"" Ponting added.""We sort of gear ourselves to not overtrain in the first part of the season, try and build up along the way. But our performances have been win one, lose one, win one. So, we need to start getting that little bit of momentum.""""Our performances have been win one, lose win. After our win against the Kings, I thought the momentum would have been going our away. It didn't happen in the last game. We are so close to turnin it around.""We've all got to trust, we've got to believe, we've got to stay upbeat and positive.

Crew-4 astronauts will do it in spaceSpaceX on Wednesday launched four astronauts to the Space Station on a mission to conduct science experiments as humans push towards the Moon and plan to journey to Mars in the coming decades. Nasa astronauts Kjell Lindgren, Robert Hines, and Jessica Watkins along with European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti will dock with the flying outpost on Thursday.As part of the mission, the four astronauts will conduct several experiments on the flying laboratory, including an attempt to grow plants without soil. The team will continue the work by the Crew-3 mission, which will hand over the experiment already underway to the new team.After docking with the Space Station on Thursday, the four-member crew will engage in a series of scientific experiments that include hydroponic (liquid-based) and aeroponic (air-based) techniques to grow plants without soil. Dubbed XROOTS, the team will use video and still images to evaluate plant growth throughout the entire life cycle.""Current space-based plant systems are small and use particulate media-based systems to deliver water and nutrients. These do not scale up well in space due to mass, containment, maintenance, and sanitation issues. Hydroponic and aeroponic techniques could enable the production of crops on a larger scale for future space exploration,"" Nasa said in a statement.Crew-4 will also be involved with the Protein-Based Artificial Retina Manufacturing experiment that aims at evaluating a manufacturing process to develop artificial human retinas using a light-activated protein called bacteriorhodopsin, which could replace the function of damaged light-sensing cells in the eye. If tested successfully, this could lead to millions on Earth getting vision using AI.The astronauts will also be working on Kibo Robot Programming Challenge that allows students to create programs to control Astrobee, a free-flying robot aboard the International Space Station. To test the technology, students have written software to use multiple free-flying satellites to construct 3D models of a target object. ""The ability to create such models of unknown objects in space using one or two small satellites has potential applications for a wide range of space missions,"" Nasa has said.Medical studies have been one of the biggest focuses for astronauts in space as they bid to ensure a healthy lifestyle for crews that will take to Moon and Mars in the future. The Crew-4 will continue the tradition as they demonstrate tests using a modified, commercial off-the-shelf device to diagnose certain medical conditions. The experiment named rHEALTH uses flow cytometry, a method using lasers to sort and identify cells, and can analyze cell count and cell characteristics; detect microorganisms, biomarkers, and proteins; and diagnose health disorders such as blood cancers.The experiments on board the flying outpost are set to enhance human understanding and not just create the technology for tomorrow but aid humans on Earth as well.",2022-04-27,"Can you grow plants without soil?

55,56,Why did Ajay Devgn hop onto the director's seat with Runway 34 after Shivaay? Actor explains,"Just two days left for the release of Runway 34, and director-actor Ajay Devgn is anxious for his dream project to hit the screens. Runway 34 is a thriller, which stars Ajay, Amitabh Bachchan, Rakul Preet Singh, Boman Irani, Angira Dhar, Aakanksha Singh. For the unaware, the film has been directed by Ajay himself. During an interview with IndiaToday.in, the superstar shared the reason for hopping onto the director's seat after Shivaay.Runway 34 is set to release in theatres on April 29 and Ajay is anxious, already. The Bollywood superstar exclusively told IndiaToday.in about the release jitters he’s been feeling. He said, ""I don't know what I'm feeling right now because I have been just running from pillar to post to finish the post-production. So once the release comes closer, then I'll start feeling something. Having said that, there is a certain kind of nervousness, not butterflies, but you're anxious more than nervous that you want to know what the result is. Because you work so hard and feel a certain way that the film should perform, at least appreciation-wise. So that anxiousness is there to know 'ab kya hoga'.""Ajay's last directorial was Shivaay (2016) and now, after more than six years, the Tanhaji actor jumped onto the directorial’ s seat again. Reasoning it out, Ajay shared, ""I was too occupied for a couple of years. Also, I was producing films, so I had to give a lot to that. Last was Tanahji (2020). Then during the pandemic, we started working on the script and that's the time I really got to work on a script properly, design, and make it. So it was just that because there was time for me and I got a fabulous idea and a great script. It is inspired by a true incident and then we took it forward, worked on the script and it shaped up so well that I thought should be made immediately.""The film is inspired by the true event of the Jet Airways Doha to Kochi flight 9W 555, which had a narrow escape on August 18, 2015, after facing difficulties landing at the Cochin International Airport due to bad weather. Did Ajay know about the incident before working on the film? ""No, not really. I knew about the incident but I didn't know the details of the incident. So when somebody came to me about the incident and when I read about it, it sounded very exciting. It is very interesting and more than that I loved the characters in the film,” he said.A post shared by Ajay Devgn (@ajaydevgn)Ajay Devgn will play the role of Captain Vikrant Khanna in Runway 34. Speaking about the real-life persona, the actor said, ""This man also is brilliant, he has got a great mind. He is fab at his job. But he is somewhere a rule breaker. So he's somewhere grey. He likes to do things on his own terms and conditions and that is a change for him. So the whole film has got a little bit of a mystery that, what he did? Is he doing it out of arrogance? Or did he do it right? Did it fall in place or it was just by chance? So all that part was very interesting for me.""Runway 34 releases on April 29.",2022-04-27,"Why did Ajay Devgn hop onto the director's seat with Runway 34 after Shivaay?

63,64,'Shahid Kapoor’s Jersey fate signals death of remakes' declares Ram Gopal Varma,"Ram Gopal Varma is known for his hot takes on social media. Most recently, he talked about Shahid Kapoor’s latest outing, Jersey and remaking South movies in Hindi. The director said that the disastrous fate of Jersey in Hindi signals the death of remakes. Ram Gopal Varma believes instead of investing in remakes, the makers should simply ‘dub and release’ the original film in Hindi.Shahid Kapoor's film Jersey has failed to impress the audience and the proof is its box office numbers. While Jersey is already struggling, Ram Gopal Varma recently criticised the Hindi remake of Nani's Telugu film. In a tweet, the director said, “The DISASTROUS fate of JERSEY film in Hindi signals the DEATH of REMAKES for the simple reason it has been proved multiple times that dubbed films like #Pushpa #RRR #KGF2 are doing far better than originals, if the content is good #DeathOfRemakes (sic).”The DISASTROUS fate of JERSEY film in Hindi signals the DEATH of REMAKES for the simple reason it has been proved multiple times that dubbed films like #Pushpa #RRR #KGF2 are doing far better than originals ,if the content is good #DeathOfRemakesFurther, Ram Gopal Varma wrote about how much money the makers would have saved if they dubbed the original Jersey and released it. “If Nani ‘s original JERSEY from Telugu was dubbed and released it would have costed the producers just 10 lakhs whereas the remake in Hindi costed 100 cr resulting in losing enoromous money ,time, effort and face #DeathOfRemakes (sic),” tweeted the director.If Nani ‘s original JERSEY from Telugu was dubbed and released it would have costed the producers just 10 lakhs whereas the remake in Hindi costed 100 cr resulting in losing enoromous money ,time, effort and face #DeathOfRemakesJersey minted Rs 5 crore on Day 3. However, the collections dipped even further on Day 4, April 25, at the box office. According to early estimates, the film collected in the range of Rs 1.70 to 1.80 crore on Monday. Hence, the total box office collection now stands at Rs 16.45 crore reportedly. Jersey might be headed towards a lifetime total of just Rs 20 crore, and end up being a major flop. The drop in collections on Monday has sealed the fate of the film on the theatrical front. It has majorly been affected by Yash's KGF: Chapter 2. Jersey might also be discontinued from the theatres by its second Friday and be replaced by Heropanti 2 and Runway 34.",2022-04-27,"'Shahid Kapoor’s Jersey fate signals death of remakes' declares Ram Gopal VarmaRam Gopal Varma is known for his hot takes on social media.

However, the collections dipped even further on Day 4, April 25, at the box office. According to early estimates, the film collected in the range of Rs 1.70 to 1.80 crore on Monday. Hence, the total box office collection now stands at Rs 16.45 crore reportedly. Jersey might be headed towards a lifetime total of just Rs 20 crore, and end up being a major flop. The drop in collections on Monday has sealed the fate of the film on the theatrical front. It has majorly been affected by Yash's KGF: Chapter 2. Jersey might also be discontinued from the theatres by its second Friday and be replaced by Heropanti 2 and Runway 34.",shahid kapoor jersey fate signal death remake declares ram gopal varmaram gopal varma known hot take social medium recently talked shahid kapoor latest outing jersey remaking south movie hindi director said disastrous fate jersey hindi signal death remake ram gopal varma belief instead investing remake maker simply dub release original film hindi shahid kapoor film jersey failed impress audience proof box office number jersey already struggling ram gopal varma recently criticised hindi remake nani telugu film tweet director said disastrous fate jersey film hindi signal death remake simple reason proved multiple time dubbed film like pushpa rrr kgf far better original content good deathofremakes sic disastrous fate jersey film hindi signal death remake simple reason proved multiple time dubbed film like pushpa rrr kgf far better original content good deathofremakesfurther ram gopal varma wrote much money maker would saved dubbed original jersey released nani original jersey telugu dubbed released would costed producer lakh whereas remake hindi costed cr resulting losing enoromous money time effort face deathofremakes sic tweeted director nani original jersey telugu dubbed released would costed producer lakh whereas remake hindi costed cr resulting losing enoromous money time effort face deathofremakesjersey minted r crore day however collection dipped even day april box office according early estimate film collected range r crore monday hence total box office collection stand r crore reportedly jersey might headed towards lifetime total r crore end major flop drop collection monday sealed fate film theatrical front majorly affected yash kgf chapter jersey might also discontinued theatre second friday replaced heropanti runway ,"[-0.16231655  0.13063074  0.03873062  0.05286027 -0.01537118 -0.25282387

68,69,Eight space missions score big in 2022 appraisal season,"After spending years and for some even a decade on an alien world, eight spacecraft have got a new life as Nasa has extended their services. While some of these vehicles are trundling on the surface of Mars, others are cruising towards asteroids, orbiting the Moon, and even trying to go into interstellar space, escaping the solar system.Eight space missions launched by Nasa got a booster after Nasa evaluated their scientific productivity and potential to deepen our knowledge and understanding of the solar system and beyond.These missions include Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, MAVEN, Mars Science Laboratory (Curiosity Rover), InSight lander, Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, OSIRIS-REx, and New Horizons. While most of these missions have got renewed life for three years, the OSIRIS-REx has been given a nine-year extension and InSight will be continued until the end of 2022.“Extended missions provide us with the opportunity to leverage NASA’s large investments in exploration, allowing continued science operations at a cost far lower than developing a new mission,"" Lori Glaze, director of the Planetary Science Division at NASA said in a statement.The eight missions that have been given a new life include:OSIRIS-APEX: The Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security-Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx), which is currently on its way to Earth after picking up core samples from asteroid Bennu, will keep on pushing. After coming close to Earth, it will deploy the sample case and head on to its new target, Apophis, an asteroid roughly 1,200 feet (roughly 370 meters) in diameter that will come within 32,000 kilometers of Earth in 2029. The spacecraft will study changes in the asteroid caused by its close flyby of Earth and use the spacecraft’s gas thrusters to attempt to dislodge and study the dust and small rocks on and below Apophis’ surface.MAVEN: The Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission is planning to study the interaction between Mars’ atmosphere and magnetic field during the upcoming solar maximum. According to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, its observations as the Sun’s activity level increases toward the maximum of its 11-year cycle will deepen our understanding of how Mars’ upper atmosphere and magnetic field interact with the Sun.InSight: Breathing its final breaths on Mars, the Interior Exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy, and Heat Transport (InSight) mission will keep providing its services till the end of 2022. It will continue seismic and weather monitoring if the spacecraft remains healthy. The spacecraft, which is on the Martian surface has been suffering due to dust accumulation, which is killing it by blocking the sunlight from reaching the solar panels.LUNAR RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER: Hovering around the Moon, JPL said that LRO will continue to study the surface and geology of Earth's natural satellite. The extension of services will allow it to study new regions away from the poles in unprecedented detail, including the Permanently Shadowed Regions (PSRs) near the poles where water ice may be found.MARS SCIENCE LABORATORY: The Mars Science Laboratory and its Curiosity rover have driven more than 16 miles (27 km) on the surface of Mars. Now, it will climb to higher elevations, exploring the critical sulfate-bearing layers that give unique insights into the history of water on Mars.NEW HORIZONS: The mission flew past Pluto in 2015 and the Kuiper Belt object (KBO) Arrokoth in 2019. Now that its mission has been extended for the second time, New Horizons will continue to explore the distant solar system out to 63 astronomical units (AU) from Earth.MARS ODYSSEY: The Odyssey orbiter is providing unique support for real-time data relay from other Mars spacecraft. It will perform new thermal studies of rocks and ice below Mars’ surface, monitor the radiation environment, and continue its long-running climate monitoring campaign.MARS RECONNAISSANCE ORBITER: MRO will study the evolution of Mars’ surface, ices, active geology, and atmosphere and climate. In addition, MRO will continue to provide important data relay service to other Mars missions.Currently, Nasa is operating 14 spacecraft across the solar system and has about 12 missions in the formulation and implementation phase with space agencies from different countries. A mission extension to eight of these missions is set to provide a wealth of data about our planetary neighbourhood and the realms beyond the solar system.",2022-04-27,"Eight space missions score big in 2022 appraisal seasonAfter spending years and for some even a decade on an alien world, eight spacecraft have got a new life as Nasa has extended their services.

69,70,Muslim law board calls attempts to introduce Uniform Civil Code unconstitutional,"The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has said that any attempt to introduce a Uniform Civil Code would be “an unconstitutional and anti-minorities move”.The AIMPLB’s comment came just a few days after Uttar Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the state was planning to introduce a Uniform Civil Code. “One law for all in one country is the need of the hour. It is required that we get out of the system of one law for one person and another for others. We are in favour of a common civil code,” he had said.WATCH | Now, Himachal Pradesh CM Jairam Thakur bats for Uniform Civil CodeGeneral Secretary of AIMPLB Hazrat Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani said, “The Constitution of India allows every citizen to lead a life according to his religion, and it has been included in the Fundamental Rights. Under this right, different personal laws have been kept for minorities and tribal classes according to their wishes and traditions, which does not cause any harm to the country.”Besides Maurya, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami also said his government was preparing the first draft of a Uniform Civil Code. Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jairam Thakur, too, said that his government will look to implement the Uniform Civil Code in the state.The AIMPLB said that it helps in maintaining mutual unity and mutual trust between the majority and the minority and the “rhetoric of the Uniform Civil Code by the Uttarakhand or Uttar Pradesh governments or the Centre is nothing but an attempt to divert attention from issues like inflation, falling economy, and rising unemployment and to increase the agenda of hatred.”The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has appealed to the government to refrain from such actions.WATCH | Delhi HC bats for Uniform Civil Code, asks Centre to take steps for its implementationThe Uniform Civil Code, which comes under Article 44 of the Constitution of India, proposes to introduce personal laws that would apply to all citizens equally, irrespective of their religion, gender, caste, etc.Article 44 states, “The State shall endeavor to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India”.

We are in favour of a common civil code,” he had said.WATCH | Now, Himachal Pradesh CM Jairam Thakur bats for Uniform Civil CodeGeneral Secretary of AIMPLB Hazrat Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani said, “The Constitution of India allows every citizen to lead a life according to his religion, and it has been included in the Fundamental Rights. Under this right, different personal laws have been kept for minorities and tribal classes according to their wishes and traditions, which does not cause any harm to the country.”Besides Maurya, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami also said his government was preparing the first draft of a Uniform Civil Code. Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jairam Thakur, too, said that his government will look to implement the Uniform Civil Code in the state.The AIMPLB said that it helps in maintaining mutual unity and mutual trust between the majority and the minority and the “rhetoric of the Uniform Civil Code by the Uttarakhand or Uttar Pradesh governments or the Centre is nothing but an attempt to divert attention from issues like inflation, falling economy, and rising unemployment and to increase the agenda of hatred.”The All India Muslim Personal Law Board has appealed to the government to refrain from such actions.WATCH | Delhi HC bats for Uniform Civil Code, asks Centre to take steps for its implementationThe Uniform Civil Code, which comes under Article 44 of the Constitution of India, proposes to introduce personal laws that would apply to all citizens equally, irrespective of their religion, gender, caste, etc.Article 44 states, “The State shall endeavor to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code throughout the territory of India”.

The state government submitted an affidavit dated April 25 in response to the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Tushar Gandhi, great grandson of Mahatma Gandhi, who had opposed the redevelopment of the Gandhi ashram.The petitioner had expressed fear that the redevelopment would change the physical structure of Sabarmati Ashram and corrupt its simplicity, which embodied the ideology of Mahatma Gandhi. The petitioner apprehended that the nature of redevelopment and over-sized involvement of government authorities in the conception and execution of the project would make it lose the Gandhian ethos, making it opposite to Gandhian principles.However, the state government refused that the proposed revamp will lose the essence of simplicity and Gandhian ethos.According to the state government, “Merely because the proposed project envisages augmented facilities that are necessary, such as the cafeteria, parking lot, parks, does not mean that it seeks to deviate from the ideology of Gandhiji. The proposed project seeks to make the Gandhi Ashram a more visitor-friendly place It is expected that with the development of the Gandhi Ashram, the number of visitors would increase.""

Yes, after slaying her way into her fan's hearts with her Cannes appearances, she is now set to represent India with her being a part of a 9-member jury at the 75th edition of the prestigious film festival which reviews and reward one of the 21 films in Competition with the Palme d'Or.Apart from Deepika, other members of the jury this year include Rebecca Hall, Noomi Rapace from Sweden, filmmakers Jasmine Trinca from Italy, Iranian director Asghar Farhadi, Ladj Ly from France, Jeff Nichols from the United States and Joachim Trier from Norway.

Moreover, the actress has also been signed as one of the global ambassadors of the brand and her Instagram feed is already a proof of her association with the popular luxury house.Now, Bollywood divas always make a style statement at the Cannes Film Festival every year, but Deepika Padukone is one of the very few who has nailed every look. In fact, she is one of the constants at the red carpet since a last couple of years and if looked closely, one can even trace the evolution of her sartorial choices.With just a few years in the industry, the diva managed to grab eyeballs. While Hollywood celebrities sizzled in western gowns at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, she made India proud in France in a beautiful white and golden Rohit Bal saree. Deepika Padukone wore a low back blouse with embellished strings pulling it together. She opted for a low bun, showing off her tattoo and completed the look with a Kundan earrings and a matching bindi.In 2017, Deepika turned up the heat in a bold dark purple Marchesa Notte ensemble as she walked down the Cannes red carpet representing cosmetics brands - L'Oreal Paris.Her second appearance in the same year was equally impressive as she chose an emerald green Brandon Maxwell one-shoulder gown with a long train and a thigh-high slit. She had aptly teamed her stunning outfit with heels by Chloe Gosselin and chose accessories by de Grisogono. A high bun and statement earrings rounded off her look.Similarly in 2018, Deepika turned heads by donning a hot pink gown from Ashi Studio’s collection. She completed her look with matching stilettoes, smokey eyes and a chic hairdo. And if this wasn't enough, Deepika left her fans asking for more when she walked down the red carpet in white Zuhair Murad gown, posing for thousands of cameras, looking like a million bucks.That's right, she cast a spell on the onlookers with her everlasting beauty and breathtakingly beautiful ensemble that featured a flowy cape and intricate work.Deepika was a vision in 2019 when she stepped out in a lime green tulle tiered gown from Giambattista Valli. Her outfit featured a long train and it was accessorized with a rose gold floral headwrap from Emily-London. She looked elegant even in her black and white Dundas couture gown.So yes, with her stunning outfits, minimum accessories and on point makeup, Deepika has surely looked nothing less than alluring in each of her Cannes appearance over the years and now all eyes are on her as she is set to walk down the red carpet as one of the jury members this year in May.",2022-04-27,"Deepika Padukone named Cannes 2022 jury member.

90,91,Vijay Babu sexual assault case: What the victim has said against the Kerala actor,"A female actor in the Malayalam film industry has accused actor Vijay Babu of sexually assaulting her for over one month. The victim has alleged that the accused, Vijay Babu, physically assaulted her and sexually exploited her from March 13 to April 14, 2022.However, Vijay Babu, in his Facebook Live post, has dismissed these allegations and said that he has not done anything wrong. Further, he said that he would file a defamation suit and “won’t let her go that easily.”The actress/victim, in a post on the Facebook group named Women Against Sexual Harassment, has elaborated the details of the alleged sexual assault.The victim, in the post, began by saying that she had known him for a few years in the industry and had worked together with him for a movie.She alleged that throughout this time he had gained her trust by being friendly and advising her, as she was a newcomer in the film industry with no proper guidance.“He behaved like my saviour for my personal and professional problems but, under the guise, has sexually exploited me,” claimed the victim.The victim alleged that the accused, Vijay Babu, had intoxicated her and sexually abused her without consent.“Whenever I was conscious, I refused consent to sex. But for him it was never an issue and, disregarding my protest, he has raped me several times during the past one-and-a half months,” she said.“When I was incapable of saying yes or no consciously, he used my body as a tool for his pleasure. He has forced himself on me and even forced me into oral sex in a car against my will. I was in a state of shock, incapable of talking or responding,” the victim said on the Facebook post.“I was under his control and was scared to speak up because of the clout , influence and power he wielded in the film industry. It was a trap to use me,” says the victim.The victim also detailed the assault that Vijay Babu allegedly did to her.“One day, for denying sex, he stamped forcefully on my stomach when I was on my periods. He spit sputum on my face and forced himself on me against my will. I was too traumatised to realise what was happening at that time but today I realise I was subjected to rape,” alleged the victim.The victim also revealed that she had discovered that there were several other women who had been subjected to this trap by Vijay Babu.“He has recorded a nude video of mine and threatened me with its consequences and also threatened my life. I fear for his blackmail and for my safety. I am not keeping my mouth shut anymore. I can't take this pain anymore. I strongly believe I will get justice for the sexual and physical assaults I have gone through by Vijay Babu. No one should go through this pain and trauma anymore in their life,” she said.“I ask all the women who had this experience from him and are silenced to speak up because together we can stop him from exploiting another girl,” she said in the post.The rape case against Malayalam actor and producer Vijay Babu has shocked the Malayalam Industry. The Ernakulam South police had registered a case against Vijay Babu on April 22, based on a complaint lodged by a young woman actress.In the complaint, she alleged that Vijaya Babu tortured her several times at his apartment in Ernakulam on a promise that she would get lots of opportunities from him in the cinema industry. Later, Vijay Babu was charged with rape and causing grievous bodily harm. The police have not yet been able to question Vijaya Babu.However, on April 26 , Vijay Babu came on Facebook live and alleged that the young woman actress was torturing him. Vijaya Babu also alleged that he was the 'real victim' and revealed the identity of the young actress.

I was too traumatised to realise what was happening at that time but today I realise I was subjected to rape,” alleged the victim.The victim also revealed that she had discovered that there were several other women who had been subjected to this trap by Vijay Babu.“He has recorded a nude video of mine and threatened me with its consequences and also threatened my life. I fear for his blackmail and for my safety. I am not keeping my mouth shut anymore. I can't take this pain anymore. I strongly believe I will get justice for the sexual and physical assaults I have gone through by Vijay Babu. No one should go through this pain and trauma anymore in their life,” she said.“I ask all the women who had this experience from him and are silenced to speak up because together we can stop him from exploiting another girl,” she said in the post.The rape case against Malayalam actor and producer Vijay Babu has shocked the Malayalam Industry. The Ernakulam South police had registered a case against Vijay Babu on April 22, based on a complaint lodged by a young woman actress.In the complaint, she alleged that Vijaya Babu tortured her several times at his apartment in Ernakulam on a promise that she would get lots of opportunities from him in the cinema industry. Later, Vijay Babu was charged with rape and causing grievous bodily harm. The police have not yet been able to question Vijaya Babu.However, on April 26 , Vijay Babu came on Facebook live and alleged that the young woman actress was torturing him. Vijaya Babu also alleged that he was the 'real victim' and revealed the identity of the young actress.

Chhavi went on to add that she had been strictly instructed by her surgeons to not post any dance reels.Chhavi Mittal took to her official Instagram handle and posted a long note to her fans and followers. ""It’s amazing how quickly we forget pain. The pain I felt after the C section, or the one I had after an ovarian surgery years ago.. or the excruciating pain of my back injury which also healed. I’m holding on to that feeling of forgetting the pain, to focus on the time that’ll come after a few days.. coz right now there’s so much pain that no amount of pain killer is helping. What’s helping though is seeing the smiles on the faces of well wishers who are coming to visit me.. and the messages u guys are sending.. typing is a struggle rn, even double tapping the msgs, but please know that I’m reading as much as i can and thank you for that.

100,101,Order successfully delivered: Our DNA came from deep space,"As we go deep into the universe to look for another rock that could harbour life, we are still trying to figure out how the process of life jumpstarted on Earth. Analysis of meteorites has now shown that the chemical ingredients of life were delivered to Earth from deep space.A team of researchers from the Institute of Low-Temperature Science (ILTS) at Hokkaido University has reported the discovery of nucleobases in three carbonaceous meteorites. Nucleobases are nitrogen-containing compounds crucial in forming DNA's characteristic double-helix structure.The study published in the journal Nature Communications states that the researchers identify various pyrimidine nucleobases such as cytosine, uracil, and thymine, and their structural isomers such as isocytosine, imidazole-4-carboxylic acid, and 6-methyluracil. It is to be noted that the DNA is made up of nucleobases called adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), meanwhile, RNA, also uses A, C and G, but swaps out thymine for uracil (U).The researchers examined material from three meteorites - one that fell in 1950 near the town of Murray in the U.S. state of Kentucky, one that fell in 1969 near the town of Murchison in Australia's Victoria state, and one that fell in 2000 near Tagish Lake in Canada's British Columbia province.All three are classified as carbonaceous chondrites, made of rocky material thought to have formed early in the solar system's history. They are carbon-rich, with the Murchison and Murray meteorites containing about 2% organic carbon by weight and the Tagish Lake meteorite containing about 4% organic carbon. Carbon is a primary constituent of organisms on Earth.The confirmation of an extraterrestrial origin of a complete set of nucleobases found in DNA and RNA buttresses the theory that meteorites could have been an important source of organic compounds necessary for the emergence of Earth's first living organisms.Scientists the world over have been engaged in understanding the process behind the beginning of life on the planet. They have been trying to unfold the mysterious circumstances on Earth that enabled various chemical compounds to come together in a warm watery setting to form a living microbe able to reproduce itself.""There is still much to learn about the chemical steps that led to the origin of life on Earth - the first self-replicating system. This research certainly adds to the list of chemical compounds that would have been present in the early Earth's prebiotic (existing before the emergence of life) soup,"" Danny Glavin of NASA's Goddard Space Flight and co-author of the study told Reuters.The two nucleobases, called cytosine and thymine, newly identified in the meteorites may have eluded detection in previous examinations because they possess a more delicate structure than the other three, the researchers said.The five nucleobases would not have been the only chemical compounds necessary for life. Among other things needed were: amino acids, which are components of proteins and enzymes; sugars, which are part of the DNA and RNA backbone; and fatty acids, which are structural components of cell membranes.""This study demonstrates that a diversity of meteoritic nucleobases could serve as building blocks of DNA and RNA on the early Earth,"" the paper read.",2022-04-27,"Order successfully delivered: Our DNA came from deep spaceAs we go deep into the universe to look for another rock that could harbour life, we are still trying to figure out how the process of life jumpstarted on Earth.

Hence, the plan includes a major sector of industrial development. Provision for logistics facilities is also to be planned in order to fulfil future industrial demands. Heritage and cultural aspects may not be prominent in YEIDA at present. But the city will act as a gateway for the region due to the upcoming International Airport,"" he added.The Yamuna Expressway Authority has also allocated Rs 76.98 crore for the smart village project.The area is bounded by the Greater Noida Authority in the North, Bulandshahar and Khurja Development Authorities in the East, and Aligarh District in the South. Apart from the Proposed Yamuna and Eastern Peripheral Expressways running through the area, the other proposed expressways like the Ganga and Upper Ganga Canal expressways are also proposed in its close vicinity.The Master Plan 2041 promotes more mixed-use development and industrial development. YEIDA population is estimated to be 41.7 lakhs by 2041. To cater to this growth, it is estimated that the area requires 8 lakh homes, 1,200 hectares of commercial space and 4,000 hectares of industrial land. Based on the vision, the existing scenario, projections and potential of the area master plan 2041 is proposed.Some major proposals include Aerotropolis, Central Business District, Olympic city and the transportation sector. Smart infrastructure for logistics, E-commerce, Intermodal Freight Hub, office parks and corridors, hotels, entertainment, retail clusters, wellness and medical centers, mixed use residential clusters are the key components of the airport city-side development.This new zone expects to create a high-density district with a distinct character and a clearly identifiable urban form. The land used in this central commercial core would include a mix of offices, retail and other business uses, along with some residential developments.Physical proposals include proposing arterial, sub arterial, collector and local roads, which constitute 13 percent of the total area.Meanwhile, public transport proposals include metro and Neo metro extensions, city bus network and routes. In addition to this, proposals for inter-state bus terminals, freight corridors, depots are also presented.A major component of transport is parking and the plan covers this aspect very well by giving provisions for on-street and off-street parking. 3 multi-modal hubs are proposed along the Yamuna Expressway.READ MORE| Noida authority approves Rs 4,880 crore budget for 2022-23 | DetailsREAD MORE| Noida authority approves Rs 757 crore budget for Jewar airport",2022-04-27,"Yamuna Expressway Authority approves Rs 4,528 crore budget for 2022-23 | DetailsThe Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) on Tuesday approved a budget of Rs 4,528 crore to be spent in the financial year 2022-23 on different developmental projects across the city.The authority has set aside Rs 1,535 crore in expenditure for land acquisition, three times more than last year's allocation.The project, Master Plan-2041 Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Area (YEIDA) (Phase-I) aims at sustainable development, evolving development vision and a road map for balanced growth of the region by regulating future spatial development to be envisaged for the horizon year, 2041.CEO Yamuna Development Authority Arunveer Singh said, ""The vision is a sustainable, efficient, well-connected and globally recognized city that capitalizes on the economic opportunity surrounding the Noida International Airport and economic corridors while ensuring the highest living standards for its citizens”.""YEIDA has huge potential for various small and medium scale industries, including cottage industries.

108,109,"Wordle 312 word of the day, April 27. 3 clues to help you guess the answer in a jiffy","Hey puzzlers! Were you able to solve today’s Wordle? We are sure you had a lot of fun solving yesterday’s puzzle because of its reference to the popular TV series Money Heist. Today’s word of the day is as easy as it gets. Let’s start with a hint. We use this word when we want to imply something that is displayed.HOW TO PLAY WORDLE?Wordle is a simple word-guessing game and requires the player to guess a five-letter word in six tries. The game is available on a website and you can play it from your mobile as well as laptop or computer. There is a grid and a keyboard on the Wordle website and you can choose your letters from it.To start, you have to type your first five-letter word guess. That forms the top row of the grid. If you get one of the letters correct in the grid, that box will turn green. If the letter that you guessed is in the word but not in the correct box, that space will turn yellow. If the player guesses anything else, the tile’s colour remains unchanged.STRATEGIES TO PLAY WORDLE BETTERTip #1: While playing Wordle, try to use letters that are common. The most common letters in the English language are e, t, a, i, o, n, s, h, and r. Try using these in the first few attempts.Tip #2: Don't waste your attempts on words that have a letter you've already eliminated, or letters in a position that they cannot be in.Tip #3: During your initial attempts, if a letter is marked yellow, it cannot be in the same position in any of the following guesses. It will also not be in any position that has already turned green. This means that you do not have to try all four remaining slots for a yellow letter.Tip #4: Think of words with common letters and give it a shot.WORDLE AND ITS INDIA CONNECTWordle was invented by Josh Wardle, a software engineer from Brooklyn, for his Indian partner, Palak Shah, who loves word games. The name of the game is in line with the creator’s surname Wardle. Palak and Josh played the game for several months before its release in October 2021, The New York Times reports.

Later, Vijay Babu was charged with rape and causing grievous physical harm. The police have not yet been able to question him on the matter.The victim began her post by saying that she had known him for a few years in the industry and had worked with him for a movie. She alleged that throughout this time he had gained her trust by being friendly and advising her, as she was a newcomer in the film industry with no proper guidance.“He behaved like my saviour for my personal and professional problems but sexually exploited me,” claimed the victim.She accused the actor of assaulting her for refusing to have sex with him.

112,113,Elon Musk owns Twitter but will Tesla pay the price?,"Elon Musk is the proud owner of Twitter, but the world's richest person's move to buy the social media platform has so far proved to be a cause of concern for Tesla. The world's most valuable automaker lost $126 billion in value on Tuesday.Tesla's share price fell by 12.18 per cent to $876.42 on the US stock market, Nasdaq, on Tuesday.Tesla is not involved in the Twitter deal, yet the company's shares have been targeted by speculators after Musk declined to disclose publicly where his cash for the acquisition is coming from.Tesla's multi-billion loss in its value came amid investors' apprehensions that Chief Executive Musk may have to sell shares to fund his $21 billion equity contribution to his $44 billion buyout of Twitter.Interestingly, the 12.18 per cent drop in Tesla's shares on Tuesday equated to a $21 billion drop in the value of Musk's stake in the company, the same as the $21 billion in cash he committed to the Twitter deal.Tesla's share plunge came against a challenging backdrop for many technology-related stocks. The Nasdaq closed at its lowest level since December 2020 on Tuesday, as investors worried about slowing global growth and more aggressive rate hikes from the US.Twitter's shares also slid on Tuesday, falling 3.9 per cent to close at $49.68 even though Musk agreed to buy it on Monday for $54.20 per share in cash.The widening spread reflects investor concern that the precipitous decline in Tesla's shares, from which Musk derives the majority of his $239 billion fortune, could lead the world's richest person to have second thoughts about the Twitter deal, according to Reuters.Market experts opined that worries about upcoming stock sales by Musk and the possibility that he is becoming distracted by Twitter weighed on Tesla shares. If Tesla's share price continues to tumble, it would jeopardize his financing, experts said.As part of the Tesla deal, Musk also took out a $12.5 billion margin loan tied to his Tesla stock. He had already borrowed against about half of his Tesla shares.ALSO READ | Elon Musk bought Twitter but who sold it",2022-04-27,"Elon Musk owns Twitter but will Tesla pay the price?Elon Musk is the proud owner of Twitter, but the world's richest person's move to buy the social media platform has so far proved to be a cause of concern for Tesla.

113,114,Major Japan railway now powered only by renewable energy,"Tokyo’s Shibuya is famed for its Scramble Crossing, where crowds of people crisscross the intersection in a scene symbolizing urban Japan’s congestion and anonymity. It may have added another boasting right.Tokyu Railways’ trains running through Shibuya and other stations were switched to power generated only by solar and other renewable sources starting April 1.That means the carbon dioxide emissions of Tokyu’s sprawling network of seven train lines and one tram service now stand at zero, with green energy being used at all its stations, including for vending machines for drinks, security camera screens and lighting.Tokyu, which employs 3,855 people and connects Tokyo with nearby Yokohama, is the first railroad operator in Japan to have achieved that goal. It says the carbon dioxide reduction is equivalent to the annual average emissions of 56,000 Japanese households.Nicholas Little, director of railway education at Michigan State University’s Center for Railway Research and Education, commends Tokyu for promoting renewable energy but stressed the importance of boosting the bottom-line amount of that renewable energy.“I would stress the bigger impacts come from increasing electricity generation from renewable sources,” he said. “The long-term battle is to increase production of renewable electricity and provide the transmission infrastructure to get it to the places of consumption.”The technology used by Tokyu’s trains is among the most ecologically friendly options for railways. The other two options are batteries and hydrogen power.And so is it just a publicity stunt, or is Tokyu moving in the right direction?Ryo Takagi, a professor at Kogakuin University and specialist in electric railway systems, believes the answer isn’t simple because how train technology evolves is complex and depends on many uncertain societal factors.In a nutshell, Tokyu’s efforts are definitely not hurting and are probably better than doing nothing. They show the company is taking up the challenge of promoting clean energy, he said.“But I am not going out of my way to praise it as great,” Takagi said.Bigger gains would come from switching from diesel trains in rural areas to hydrogen powered lines and from switching gas-guzzling cars to electric, he said.Tokyu paid an undisclosed amount to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility behind the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, for certification vouching for its use of renewables, even as Japan continues to use coal and other fossil fuels.“We don’t see this as reaching our goal but just a start,” said Assistant Manager Yoshimasa Kitano at Tokyu’s headquarters, a few minutes’ walk from the Scramble Crossing.Such steps are crucial for Japan, the world’s sixth-biggest carbon emitter, to attain its goal of becoming carbon-neutral by 2050.Only about 20% of Japan’s electricity comes from renewable sources, according to the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies, a Tokyo-based independent non-profit research organization.That lags way behind New Zealand, for instance, where 84% of power used comes from renewable energy sources. New Zealand hopes to make that 100% by 2035.The renewable sources driving Tokyu trains include hydropower, geothermal-power, wind power and solar power, according to Tokyo Electric Power Co., the utility that provides the electricity and tracks its energy sourcing.Tokyu has more than 100 kilometers (64 miles) of railway tracks serving 2.2 million people a day, including commuting “salarymen” and “salarywomen” and schoolchildren in uniforms.Since the nuclear disaster in Fukushima, when a tsunami set off by a massive earthquake sent three reactors into meltdowns, Japan has shut down most of its nuclear plants and ramped up use of coal-fired power plants.The country aims to have 36%-38% of its energy come from renewable sources by 2030, while slashing overall energy use.Tokyu Railways has sought to publicize its effort with posters and YouTube clips.Still, Ryuichi Yagi, who heads his own company that used to make neckties but has switched to wallets appeared surprised to learn he was riding on a “green train.”“I had no idea,” he said.Yagi switched his business because of Japan’s “cool biz” movement. It encourages male office workers to doff their suits for open-necked short-sleeve shirts to conserve energy by keeping air conditioning to a minimum in hot summer months.In a sense, he said, “I lead a very green life.”",2022-04-27,"Major Japan railway now powered only by renewable energyTokyo’s Shibuya is famed for its Scramble Crossing, where crowds of people crisscross the intersection in a scene symbolizing urban Japan’s congestion and anonymity.

It encourages male office workers to doff their suits for open-necked short-sleeve shirts to conserve energy by keeping air conditioning to a minimum in hot summer months.In a sense, he said, “I lead a very green life.”",major japan railway powered renewable energytokyo shibuya famed scramble crossing crowd people crisscross intersection scene symbolizing urban japan congestion anonymity may added another boasting right tokyu railway train running shibuya station switched power generated solar renewable source starting april mean carbon dioxide emission tokyu sprawling network seven train line one tram service stand zero green energy used station including vending machine drink security camera screen lighting tokyu employ people connects tokyo nearby yokohama first railroad operator japan achieved goal say carbon dioxide reduction equivalent annual average emission japanese household nicholas little director railway education michigan state university center railway research education commends tokyu promoting renewable energy stressed importance boosting bottom line amount renewable energy would stress bigger impact come increasing electricity generation renewable source said long term battle increase production renewable electricity provide transmission infrastructure get place consumption technology used tokyu train among ecologically friendly option railway two option battery hydrogen power publicity stunt tokyu moving right direction ryo takagi professor kogakuin university specialist electric railway system belief answer simple train technology evolves complex depends many uncertain societal factor nutshell tokyu effort definitely hurting probably better nothing show company taking challenge promoting clean energy said going way praise great takagi said bigger gain would come switching diesel train rural area hydrogen powered line switching gas guzzling car electric said tokyu paid undisclosed amount tokyo electric power co utility behind fukushima nuclear disaster certification vouching use renewables even japan continues use coal fossil fuel see reaching goal start said assistant manager yoshimasa kitano tokyu headquarters minute walk scramble crossing step crucial japan world sixth biggest carbon emitter attain goal becoming carbon neutral japan electricity come renewable source according institute sustainable energy policy tokyo based independent non profit research organization lag way behind new zealand instance power used come renewable energy source new zealand hope make renewable source driving tokyu train include hydropower geothermal power wind power solar power according tokyo electric power co utility provides electricity track energy sourcing tokyu kilometer mile railway track serving million people day including commuting salarymen salarywomen schoolchildren uniform since nuclear disaster fukushima tsunami set massive earthquake sent three reactor meltdown japan shut nuclear plant ramped use coal fired power plant country aim energy come renewable source slashing overall energy use tokyu railway sought publicize effort poster youtube clip still ryuichi yagi head company used make necktie switched wallet appeared surprised learn riding green train idea said yagi switched business japan cool biz movement encourages male office worker doff suit open necked short sleeve shirt conserve energy keeping air conditioning minimum hot summer month sense said lead green life ,"[-0.13766638  0.10932275  0.0340074   0.04487987 -0.01358056 -0.21309749

Bihar has been reeling under a maximum temperature of 40 degrees Celsius and hot westerlies have been sweeping through the state, making conditions worse.The residents of Patna may not expect relief from hot weather conditions till Friday as the maximum temperature would breach the 40 degrees mark.According to MeT, most places in south Bihar may have maximum temperatures above 40 degree Celsius to 42 degrees Celsius, while northern parts of the state may experience 36 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius.Districts such as Patna, Bhagalpur, Jamui, Buxar, Vaishali, Khagaria, Banka, Nalana, Nawada, Rohtas, Jehanabad, Sheikhpura, Lakhisarai, Munger, Khagaria, West Champaran, East Champaran, Gopalganj, Siwan and Saran have been warned of heatwave in the coming days.The Patna Meteorological Centre has sounded a heatwave alert in the southern and north-western parts of Bihar on Wednesday. The weather agency has given a heatwave warning for the southern parts as well on Thursday and the maximum temperature is likely to breach the 40 degrees mark.On Tuesday, the maximum temperature was above the 40 degrees mark in 19 out of 38 districts in Bihar. Buxar was the hottest place in the state on Tuesday with the maximum temperature at 44.7 degrees Celsius.ALSO READ| Heatwave conditions likely in Bihar till April 26: MeTGaya and Patna had the maximum temperature at 43 degrees Celsius, which is expected to soar in the next three days.Patna, Bhagalpur, Jamui, Buxar, Vaishali, Khagaria, Banka, Nawada and Nalanda experienced heatwave conditions on Tuesday too. However, north-eastern parts of the state can expect some relief from the scorching heat as the weatherman has predicted thunderstorms and lightning in Araria, Kishanganj, Sheohar, Sitamarhi, West Champaran and East Champaran.The IMD declares a heatwave condition when the normal temperature is 40 degrees Celsius and more and the actual temperature continues to be 4.5 notches above normal for the two consecutive days.An official at Patna MeT told TOI, ""Hot westerly and north-westerly are sweeping through the state at an average speed of 10-12kmph.

119,120,Watch LIVE | SpaceX launches four astronauts to Space Station on Falcon-9,"Four astronauts part of the Crew-4 mission were launched to the International Space Station on Wednesday. Nasa astronauts Kjell Lindgren, Robert Hines, and Jessica Watkins and European Space Agency astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti lifted off from Kennedy Space Centre.While this is the first spaceflight for Hines and Watkins, Lindgren and Cristoforetti have flown before. The crew will spend several months conducting science and maintenance aboard the orbiting laboratory before the four astronauts return to Earth in the fall of 2022.The crew is flying on a new Crew Dragon spacecraft and will launch on a Falcon 9 booster that has previously sent three missions into space. As per tradition, the Crew has named the new spacecraft as Freedom to celebrate a fundamental human right, and the industry and innovation that emanate from the unencumbered human spirit.Lindgren and Hines were assigned to the Crew-4 mission in February 2021 followed by Cristoforetti, who came on board in March 2021, and Watkins was added as the fourth crew member in November 2021.The mission will be commanded by Lindgren, who is responsible for all phases of flight, from launch to re-entry, and will serve as an Expedition 67 flight engineer aboard the station. This will be Lindgren’s second spaceflight since becoming an astronaut in 2009.Hines is the pilot of the Crew Dragon spacecraft and second in command for the mission. He is responsible for spacecraft systems and performance. Onboard the station, he will serve as an Expedition 67 flight engineer. Watkins is a mission specialist for Crew-4 and will work closely with the commander and pilot to monitor the spacecraft during the dynamic launch and re-entry phases of flight.Meanwhile, Cristoforetti will also serve as a mission specialist, working to monitor the spacecraft during the dynamic launch and re-entry phases of flight. This will be her second trip to space following five months in 2015 as an Expedition 42/43 flight engineer. Born in Milan, Italy, she was a fighter pilot in the Italian Air Force prior to being selected as an ESA astronaut in 2009.The Falcon 9 first stage that was used to launch this mission flew previously on SpaceX’s 22nd commercial resupply mission to the station in June 2021, NASA’s SpaceX Crew-3 mission in November 2021, and SpaceX’s Turksat 5B mission in December 2021.

Two mall security guards and five staff of Lost Lemons bar, where the incident took place, have been arrested.A total of nine people have been connected to the murder and eight of them have been identified, while the identity of the last man remains unknown. One of the accused is absconding and police have started a hunt to nab the person.A 30-year-old man, Brijesh Rai from Chapra, Bihar, was allegedly thrashed to death by the bouncers of Lost Lemons Bar at Gardens Galleria mall in Noida’s Sector-38 on Monday night.An argument had broken out over the payment of the bill. The argument soon escalated into a brawl, where bouncers thrashed Brijesh and fatally injured him.Brijesh was taken to a hospital but was declared “brought dead”.According to Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police, Noida, Ranvijay Singh, the initial investigation revealed that the people at the bar had a fight over the bill. “The statements of the people present with Brijesh will also be taken, after which the real reason for the murder will be known,” he said.Meanwhile, an investigative reporter from India Today reached out to two of the pub staff taken into police custody for questioning.The detained men claimed that the guest had been trying to avoid paying the bill, which led to an argument with one of the pub employees.The first suspect said, “The man, who has now expired, stepped into our outlet. He was already drunk.”“He took some more drinks inside. He was evasive when asked about paying the bill. He kept telling the staff to come 15, 20, 30 minutes later.

126,127,LAPD officer says Amber not a victim of domestic violence in Johnny Depp trial,"A Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer has now testified in Johnny Depp's defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard. The officer said that she has responded to a 911 call at the ex-couple's penthouse in LA on May 21, 2016. However, she found no signs of physical abuse on Amber Heard.The whole controversy started when Johnny's ex-wife Amber wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post on how she had become a victim of domestic violence. While she never mentioned Depp, the actor’s lawyers claimed that it damaged his career and reputation. The Pirates of the Caribbean star then filed a $50 million defamation case against his ex-wife.“I did a sweep of the location for a suspect,” Officer Melissa Saenz said, according to Deadline. Saenz told the court she and her partner searched two penthouses but found no suspect. There were also so signs of property damage. When asked by attorneys about red marks on Amber Heard’s face, Saenz said she looked “flushed” like she’d been crying, but there were no physical injuries on her.Officer Melissa Saenz bluntly said, “I did not identify her (Heard) as a victim of domestic violence.”“We met with the victim. We checked the location, the husband wasn’t there, and the victim advised us that she’d just had an argument and that she wasn’t going to give us any further information. Because we didn’t identify a crime, we issued her a business card, letting her know that she could reach out to us later if she wanted to cooperate,” Saenz said.The LAPD veteran added that she did not file a report and cited the incident as closed because there was no crime.",2022-04-27,"LAPD officer says Amber not a victim of domestic violence in Johnny Depp trialA Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer has now testified in Johnny Depp's defamation case against ex-wife Amber Heard.

130,131,"With PK-Congress deal off, poll strategist can be coordinator for Opposition, says Prithviraj Chavan","Hours after poll strategist Prashant Kishor declined the Congress's offers to join the party on Tuesday, former Maharashtra chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said that Kishor could work as a coordinator among the Opposition parties.ALSO READ | Why Prashant Kishor-Congress talks collapsed?“It is clear that Prashant Kishor won't be an office-bearer of Congress. But he can still play the role of coordinator for the Opposition parties,” Chavan told Mumbai Tak. He tried to draw a parallel between Kishor and the late Ahmed Patel, a stalwart Congress leader known for his political manoeuvring skills. “After Ahmed Patel's death, the Congress doesn't have anyone who can coordinate with like-minded parties. Prashant Kishor can bring all Opposition parties to a table,” Chavan said.An experienced Chavan, who has worked as an All India Congress Committee General Secretary, also disclosed that Kishor had discussed his plans for Congress at their meeting in Mumbai a couple of months ago. “He had told me that there was a need to stop Narendra Modi as he [Modi] is a danger to democracy. Kishor had almost joined the Congress. He laid several conditions, though. He backed out because these conditions were not accepted,” Chavan said.ALSO READ | As G23 feels its way forward, the Rahul Gandhi question weighs heavyIndia Today asked Chavan if Prashant Kishor is appointed as a coordinator for the Opposition, will the Congress be pushed on a backfoot as the strategist would give more weightage to regional parties in the seat-sharing? Chavan replied that there would be “some give and take”. “That doesn't mean we will compromise our position.”Chavan reiterated that the G-23’s main demand was conducting an election for the post of the Congress president. “Anyone can contest the post. Even Rahulji (Gandhi) can contest and win,” Chavan said. He argued that an elected Congress president will have the authority to negotiate seat-sharing with other parties. “S/he will be in a position to take firm decisions. I am not getting into whether the Congress president should be a Gandhi or a non-Gandhi. I am only insisting that the person should be elected, not nominated.”ALSO READ | Prashant Kishor declines Congress offer, won't join partyChavan said that the Congress’s internal elections have not taken place for 24 years. “I am saying even the district presidents should be elected,” he said.“The Congress needs to have a concrete plan for the next Assembly elections in 12 states as well as for the Lok Sabha polls.

But he can still play the role of coordinator for the Opposition parties,” Chavan told Mumbai Tak. He tried to draw a parallel between Kishor and the late Ahmed Patel, a stalwart Congress leader known for his political manoeuvring skills. “After Ahmed Patel's death, the Congress doesn't have anyone who can coordinate with like-minded parties. Prashant Kishor can bring all Opposition parties to a table,” Chavan said.An experienced Chavan, who has worked as an All India Congress Committee General Secretary, also disclosed that Kishor had discussed his plans for Congress at their meeting in Mumbai a couple of months ago. “He had told me that there was a need to stop Narendra Modi as he [Modi] is a danger to democracy. Kishor had almost joined the Congress. He laid several conditions, though. He backed out because these conditions were not accepted,” Chavan said.ALSO READ | As G23 feels its way forward, the Rahul Gandhi question weighs heavyIndia Today asked Chavan if Prashant Kishor is appointed as a coordinator for the Opposition, will the Congress be pushed on a backfoot as the strategist would give more weightage to regional parties in the seat-sharing?

133,134,Howard Stern says Johnny Depp is overacting during Amber Heard trial,"The Johnny Depp and Amber Heard trial is making headlines these days. It all started after the actor's ex-wife Amber wrote an opinion piece in The Washington Post on how she had become a victim of domestic violence. While she never mentioned Depp, the actor’s lawyers claimed that it damaged his career and reputation. Many celebrities have voiced their opinion on the case. Amid them, popular radio host Howard Stern branded Johnny Depp a 'huge narcissist' and called him out for 'overacting' in court during the ongoing defamation trial against ex-wife Amber Heard.Amid the ongoing defamation suit between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, the actor was criticised by Howard Stern for overacting while testifying against Amber Heard during their defamation trial, which has been live-streamed since April 11. During an episode of his SiriusXM show, the 68-year-old radio host also called Johnny Depp 'narcissist'. “The reason he wanted that on — he wanted it televised [because] that’s what narcissists do,” Howard said.“They think they can talk their way out of anything,” Stern continued. “I think Johnny Depp is a huge narcissist and what I mean by that is — he figured, ‘I’ll put this on TV and because I’m so persuasive and because I’m so smart, I’m such a wonderful guy.’”The former America’s Got Talent judge also accused Johnny Depp of putting on a show. “I’ll play you some clips from the Johnny Depp trial. If he isn’t acting — I mean, he’s so overacting because he’s writing his own material as he goes along,” he continued. “You know, I gotta tell you, he’s wrong. He shouldn’t be putting this on TV in any shape.”Johnny Depp and Amber Heard met on the sets of The Rum Diary (2009) and started dating a while later. They tied the knot in 2015. In 2016, Amber filed for divorce, alleging that Johnny had physically abused her during their marriage under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Johnny denied the accusations and stated that it was Amber, who was ""attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse."" Johnny and Amber’s divorce was finalised in 2017.

Having won five games on the trot, the Orange Army moved to the second spot from the bottom of the points table, before being pushed down to three by a resilient win from RR against Royal Challengers Bangalore on Tuesday, 26 April.A win in their next game will take them to the top of the points table on the basis of a superior net run rate than the Titans. Their pace attack, comprising Umran Malik, Marco Jansen, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, have stepped up and made life tough for the opposition batters.The Titans, on the other hand, have flourished big time under the leadership of Hardik Pandya. Having won six out of their seven matches, the IPL newbies haven't flattered to deceive by any stretch of the imagination. Another win will take them one step closer to the semis.But ahead of their upcoming game, the Titans need to remember that their only loss thus far has come against the Sunrisers. Earlier this month, the Sunrisers beat the Titans by eight wickets after Kane Williamson's 57-run knock that fetched him the Player of the Match award.Hardik Pandya (GT): The Baroda-born all-rounder is in the form of his life as he is the leading run-scorer for the Titans. Having scored 204 in his last three outings at an average of 204, the right-hander has been exceptional.

151,152,The plan was to bowl hard lengths: Kuldeep Sen after match-winning four-wicket haul ,"Rajasthan Royals’ (RR) fast bowler Kuldeep Sen said that he planned on bowling hard lengths in the match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) on Tuesday, April 26 at the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) Stadium in Pune. Kuldeep picked up a four-wicket haul and helped the Royals overtake the Gujarat Titans (GT) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) to the top of the table.The 25-year-old started his Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 sojourn with his last-over heroics against The Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) where he restricted an ominous-looking Marcus Stoinis. But after his first two outings, he had to sit out due to a side strain.The pacer said that he got an idea of the pitch’s nature in Tuesday’s game after watching RCB bowlers Josh Hazlewood and Mohammed Siraj.“After my second game, I missed a couple of games as I suffered a side strain at the nets during practice. Watching Hazlewood and Siraj, I realised that the ball was stopping a bit. So the plan was to bowl hard lengths. The talks were about hitting the right lengths and preventing run-flow, since we had seen that in the first innings,” Kuldeep was quoted as saying after the match.Kuldeep started his spell by picking the all-important wickets of RCB skipper Faf du Plessis and hard-hitting batter Glenn Maxwell. After the two wickets, he found himself on a hat-trick, but he couldn’t accomplish the milestone.Nevertheless, he went on to get two more scalps of Wanindu Hasaranga and Harshal Patel to finish with more than decent bowling figures of 3.3-0-20-4.The Royals are next set to lock horns with Rohit Sharma’s Mumbai Indians (MI) on Saturday, April 30 at the Dr. DY Patil Sports Academy in Mumbai.",2022-04-27,"The plan was to bowl hard lengths: Kuldeep Sen after match-winning four-wicket haul Rajasthan Royals’ (RR) fast bowler Kuldeep Sen said that he planned on bowling hard lengths in the match against the Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) on Tuesday, April 26 at the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) Stadium in Pune.

154,155,"Poland, Bulgaria say Russia suspending natural gas supplies","Polish and Bulgarian officials said Tuesday that Moscow is cutting off natural gas deliveries to their countries due to their refusal to pay in Russian rubles, a demand made by President Vladimir Putin after sanctions were levied against his nation over the invasion of Ukraine.Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom informed the two EU and NATO member nations that gas supplies will be suspended starting Wednesday, their governments said.The suspensions would be the first since Putin’s announcement last month that “unfriendly foreign buyers” would have to transact with Gazprom in rubles instead of dollars and euros. Only Hungary has agreed to do so, with other countries rejecting the demand as an unacceptable, one-sided breach of contracts and a violation of sanctions.ALSO READ: Do not underestimate risks of nuclear war, Western weapons in Ukraine legitimate targets: RussiaIf deliveries are halted to other countries as well, it could cause economic pain in Europe, driving natural gas prices up and possibly leading to rationing — but it would also deal a blow to Russia’s own economy.Wednesday’s cutoffs will affect deliveries of Russian gas to Poland through the Yamal-Europe pipeline, according to Polish state gas company PGNiG, and to Bulgaria via the TurkStream pipeline, that country’s Energy Ministry aaid.The Yamal-Europe carries gas from Russia to Poland and Germany, via Belarus.

157,158,Three out of four kids infected with Covid in US,"Three out of every four US children have been infected with the coronavirus and more than half of all Americans had signs of previous infections, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers estimated in a report Tuesday.The researchers examined blood samples from more than 200,000 Americans and looked for virus-fighting antibodies made from infections, not vaccines. They found that signs of past infection rose dramatically between December and February, when the more contagious omicron variant surged through the US.Read: Beijing to test 21 million residents amid fresh Omicron outbreak in ChinaFor Americans of all ages, about 34 per cent had signs of prior infection in December. Just two months later, 58 per cent did.“I did expect it to increase. I did not expect it to increase quite this much,” said Dr Kristie Clarke, co-leader of a CDC team that tracks the extent of coronavirus infections.The news came as Pfizer sought permission to offer a booster dose to kids ages 5 to 11, just like people 12 and older can get.In the CDC report, the most striking increase was in children. The percentage of those 17 and under with antibodies rose from about 45 per cent in December to about 75 per cent in February.The older people were, the less likely they had evidence of past infections. That may be because older adults have higher vaccination rates and they may be more likely to take other Covid-19 precautions, such as wearing masks and avoiding crowds, Clarke said.Read: Covaxin cleared for kids aged 6 to 12 years, Bharat Biotech asked to keep submitting safety dataReported Covid-19 cases had a huge surge in December and January, then fell almost as dramatically as they had risen. But daily case counts have been trending up again in recent weeks.The case numbers are believed to be an undercount, but officials do think recent increases reflect a true rise in infections. Many Covid-19 infections are mild enough that patients do not seek care or confirmatory lab tests. CDC officials say they plan to release a study soon that estimates that in recent months there were three infections for every reported case.Another recent trend: US health officials say they have seen two weeks of increases in Covid-19 hospitalisations, though the numbers remain relatively low. Hospital admissions number about 1,600 per day, a 9 per cent increase in the prior week, the CDC reported.Read: Hard lockdown fears trigger panic buying in Beijing amid Covid surgeAvailable evidence nevertheless offers reason to be hopeful about how the pandemic is going, officials suggested.“We are not anticipating more severe disease from some of these subvariants, but we are actively studying them,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said Tuesday.The tests that showed how many people had previous infections can detect antibodies for one to two years after infection, and possibly longer. Studies have shown previous infection can protect some people against severe disease and hospitalization, but CDC officials stressed that the previously infected should still get Covid-19 vaccines.The study looked for any detectable level of antibodies; it did not distinguish how many people had antibody levels that might be protective. Scientists are still trying to understand what role these kinds of antibodies play in protection from future virus exposures.Officials continue to urge Americans to get vaccines and boosters, which offer additional protection against Covid-19 for all, including those who were previously infected.Currently, the US offers a booster dose starting at age 12 but Pfizer and BioNTech on Tuesday asked the Food and Drug Administration to allow healthy elementary-age kids to also get one -- about six months after their last shot. The companies cited a small study showing the extra shot for kids ages 5 to 11 revved up antibodies capable of fighting the super-contagious omicron variant.

166,167,"91-yr-old Padma awardee evicted from govt house, artists question move","A 91-year-old Padma Shri winning Odissi dancer was evicted from a government bungalow on Tuesday, April 26, after the accommodation allotment expired due to a policy change in 2008. The eviction took place at the government-owned home, currently occupied by Guru Mayadhar Raut, a 91-year-old Odissi dancer, in Asiad Village, South Delhi.About 12 other artists, including Mohiniyattam dancer Bharati Shivaji, Kuchipudi dancer Guru V Jayarama Rao, Dhrupad singer Ustad F Wasifuddin Dagar, Rani Shinghal, Kathak expert Geetanjali Lal, lithographer KR Subanna, sarangi player Kamal Sabri, Devraj Dakoji, Kamalini, artist Jatin Das, Pt Bhajan Sopori and singer Rita Ganguly, will also face similar proceedings in the coming days.For decades, artists such as classical dancers, painters, singers, and photographers have resided in government bungalows provided by the central government under a discretionary quota. Some allotments date back to the 1980s, while others were distributed in the early 2000s.The government has now asked them to vacate their homes, claiming that the allotment expired due to a policy change in 2008. The government has also said that the artists have not paid licence fee arrears for several years.Eviction officials landed at the home of Odissi dancer and Padma awardee Guru Mayadhar Raut on Tuesday afternoon. Within hours, his belongings were out on the street.The artists say that they have not been given adequate time to vacate the premises and wonder why they are being evicted at this late stage of their lives.Raut himself is over 91-years-old. Many of the other artists facing this eviction are also over the age of 70.An overwhelmed Madhumita Raut, daughter of Guru Mayadhar Raut, spoke to India Today and questioned why no notice of the proceedings was provided to them.""They walked in and told us we had to lock the door by 5 pm. The very least they could have done was give us a 24-hour notice, or a week or so to vacate the house. We are artists. We don't have any other homes where we can relocate at a moment's notice,"" said Madhumita.""Many of us have received prestigious honours. Many are Padma Shri awardees. Is this the respect and dignity we are shown?"" questioned Madhumita.The 91-year-old Guru also expressed shock at the eviction. ""They came in and began throwing things away. We would have vacated if they had given us some notice.""The government and the High Court, on the other hand, have said that the artists are not permitted to remain in government housing after the allotment period has expired.The Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) official on the spot, who declined to give his name, said that eviction orders were issued in January of this year and that it was the residents' responsibility to have vacated the premises.""There are eviction orders in place. There was a grace period. We are also subject to orders,"" he said.Mudit, a Guru Raut disciple, criticised the eviction proceedings and questioned the estates office's haste.""So many politicians have overstayed in government bungalows. Jhuggi clusters and illegal encroachments are allowed to stay, but no such help is extended to such senior artists. How is this fair?"" Mudit asked.Looking at the timeline of the legal proceedings, it appears that the artists have clung to hope even after receiving no favourable orders from the government or courts.--In October 2020, MoUD issued letters to artists informing them that their allotment has expired and that the premises must be vacated by December 31, 2020 due to unpaid licence fees for accommodation.--Artists approached the court, stating they should not be evicted during the Covid-19 pandemic.--On August 5, 2021, a show cause notice was issued and challenged in the Delhi High Court.--Orders of eviction were issued against artists on January 21, 2022, and were challenged in the High Court.--On February 2, 2022, the eviction proceedings were upheld by a single judge of the Delhi High Court in an order. Artists were given a two-month grace period to vacate their residences by April 25. The court also pointed out that the artists had failed to pay the licence fee arrears.--The order was challenged before the division bench.--A two-judge panel led by the acting Chief Justice on April 2, 2022, issued no relief. The court ordered that the houses be vacated in accordance with the February order. The plea was also withdrawn.--On February 26, 2022, the eviction department begins proceedings at Guru Mayadhar Raut's house. Others are set to be evicted in the coming days.A fresh petition was moved before the Delhi High Court on Tuesday, seeking more time to vacate, a relook at housing policies and some relief owing to the old age of the affected artists.Seema Subbanna, wife of former Lalit Kala Academy chairman KR Subbanna, who is also facing eviction, says the artists expected some leniency from the government.""Everyone deserves to live a dignified life. We're not saying we won't leave. We requested some time to move. My husband is the allottee, and he is too unwell to be moved. Is there no regard for such senior artists? We are the ones who have been preserving various art forms, and we are called to be a part of various committees and cultural showcases, but no one listens when we need help,"" said Subbanna.Wasifuddin Dagar, a Dhrupad singer, also expressed surprise at the eviction. ""We are still trying to fight the case in court. We should have been given more time. Why did they disrespect a 91-year-old awardee's dignity by throwing his belongings out of the house?"" Dagar inquired.Some of the artists attempted to contact Ministry of Urban Development officials as the police and eviction officers arrived. However, they were met with disappointment.Lawyers for the artists have knocked on the doors of the Delhi High Court yet again. The artists have requested that they be given a few more days to vacate the houses.Senior advocate Priya Hingorani told India Today that the plea has been listed for urgent hearing before the bench of Delhi High Court acting Chief Justice Vipin Sanghi and will be heard on Wednesday.In the meantime, the belongings of a 91-year-old dance legend have been loaded onto trucks and into the cars of well-wishers, awaiting a decision.READ | Housing society built by state-owned NBCC declared unsafe, residents asked to vacate",2022-04-27,"91-yr-old Padma awardee evicted from govt house, artists question moveA 91-year-old Padma Shri winning Odissi dancer was evicted from a government bungalow on Tuesday, April 26, after the accommodation allotment expired due to a policy change in 2008.

168,169,Only 1 in 4 Covid patients feel fully recovered after a year: UK study,"A year after having Covid-19, only around one in four hospitalised patients feel fully recovered, according to a UK study published in The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal which found that the disease affects women worse than men.The team led by researchers at the University of Leicester, UK, found that being female versus being male, having obesity and having had mechanical ventilation in hospital were all associated with a lower probability of feeling fully recovered in one year.The most common ongoing long-Covid symptoms were fatigue, muscle pain, physically slowing down, poor sleep, and breathlessness.""The limited recovery from 5 months to 1 year after hospitalisation in our study across symptoms, mental health, exercise capacity, organ impairment, and quality-of-life is striking,"" said Rachael Evans, from the University of Leicester.""In our clusters, female sex and obesity were also associated with more severe ongoing health impairments including reduced exercise performance and health-related quality of life at 1 year, potentially highlighting a group that might need higher intensity interventions such as supervised rehabilitation,"" she added.READ | US Vice President Kamala Harris tests positive for Covid-19The study used data from the post-hospitalisation Covid-19 (PHOSP-Covid) study which assessed adults aged 18 years and over who had been hospitalised with Covid-19 across the UK and subsequently discharged.Patients from 39 UK National Health Service (NHS) hospitals were included, who agreed to five-month and 1-year follow-up assessments in addition to their clinical care.Recovery was assessed using patient-reported outcome measures, physical performance, and organ function at 5 months and one year after hospital discharge.The researchers also took samples of participants' blood at the five-month visit to analyse it for the presence of various inflammatory proteins.READ | Beijing to test 21 million residents amid fresh Omicron outbreak in ChinaA total of 2,320 participants discharged from hospital between March 7, 2020, and April 18, 2021, were assessed at 5 months after discharge and 807 participants completed both the 5-month and 1-year visits at the time of analysis.These 807 patients had a mean age of 59 years, 279 were women and 28 per cent received invasive mechanical ventilation, the researchers said.The proportion of patients reporting full recovery was similar between 5 months and 1 year, they said. In an earlier study, the authors had identified four groups or 'clusters' of symptom severity at five months, which were confirmed by the new study at one year.Of the 2,320 participants, 1,636 had sufficient data to allocate them to a cluster: 319 had very severe physical and mental health impairment, 493 had severe physical and mental health impairment,179 moderate physical health impairment with cognitive impairment, and 645 mild mental and physical health impairment.Having obesity, reduced exercise capacity, a greater number of symptoms, and increased levels of the inflammatory biomarker C-reactive protein were associated with the more severe clusters, according to the researchers.In both the very severe and the moderate with cognitive impairment clusters, levels of the inflammatory biomarker interleukin-6 (IL-6) were higher when compared with the mild cluster, they said. ""Our study highlights an urgent need for health-care services to support this large and rapidly increasing patient population in whom a substantial burden of symptoms exist, including reduced exercise capacity and substantially decreased health-related quality of life one year after hospital discharge,"" said Professor Christopher Brightling from the University of Leicester.""Without effective treatments, long Covid could become a highly prevalent new long-term condition.

This photo was taken at Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan, in 2019, during an event where the Israeli PM was not an attendee.A reverse search of the image revealed it was shot on June 13, 2019, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit, held in Kyrgyzstan's capital, Bishkek.At the time, this photo and the video from which it was taken went viral because Khan reportedly broke diplomatic protocol again by sitting while everyone else stood to welcome the head of state entering the hall.As seen in the video shared by the official Twitter account of Khan’s party, PTI, the ex-PM walked in, went straight to his seat, and sat down while other leaders stood till each of the heads of state arrived.

176,177,Fact Check: 2020 bike rally from Assam passed off as recent incident where Bajrang Dal members were arrested,"A video of a bike rally, with participants brandishing swords and machetes, went viral with the claim that in Assam, the police stopped this Bajrang Dal rally midway and arrested those present.Several Facebook users shared this video that showed a stream of two-wheelers. Many participants of the supposed rally were wearing orange and saffron attires. At one point in the video, police intervention was seen.In the video, when asked by cops about his affiliations, one of the participants said he was with the Bajrang Dal. Following that, they asked him if they had the necessary permits to organise a roadshow. To this, the man said he did not know. He was then shoved into a police car. The video also showed cops questioning another professed Bajrang Dal member about permits.The India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral video was nearly two years old. In October 2020, a group in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district took out a bike rally, where they brandished swords and other weapons. Reportedly, the participants attended an “Astra Poojan” ceremony organised by the Bajrang Dal prior to the rally.The viral posts are archived here and here.The first thing we noticed was the logo of EastMojo.com, a digital news outlet that focuses on the Northeast. The video also mentioned the location — Tinsukia, Assam — in the top-left corner.Taking this as a clue, we ran a search and found the original news clip uploaded to the EastMojo YouTube channel on October 27, 2020. The title read, “Assam youths brandish swords during bike rally; one admits to be member of Bajrang Dal.”EastMojo reported that on October 26, 2020, a group of around 70 men took out a bike rally bearing swords and axes in their hands in Tinsukia. The rally was allegedly carried out by the Bajrang Dal on the occasion of “Astra Poojan”.“In about 20-25 motorcycles, men carrying swords in their hands as they took out a rally from Thana Chariali towards Hijugoori, as we noticed it and followed them. Upon questioning one of them admitted to be a member of Bajrang Dal,” the news portal quoted a police officer. Cops reportedly detained four men who were part of the rally and seized three motorcycles.The incident was covered by other local media outlets. The news portal Insidene quoted a Bajrang Dal member who said that the organisation had held an “Astra Poojan”, but added that he did not give “permission to any of the youths to take out a bike rally.”Thus, we conclude that the video of a two-year-old incident from Assam was shared on social media without any mention of when it was from.The number of crows determines the intensity of the lie.",2022-04-27,"Fact Check: 2020 bike rally from Assam passed off as recent incident where Bajrang Dal members were arrestedA video of a bike rally, with participants brandishing swords and machetes, went viral with the claim that in Assam, the police stopped this Bajrang Dal rally midway and arrested those present.Several Facebook users shared this video that showed a stream of two-wheelers.

178,179,Bombay High Court grants anticipatory bail to lawyer Gunratan Sadawarte in Pune FIR,"The Bombay High Court on Tuesday granted anticipatory bail to Mumbai-based lawyer Gunratan Sadarwarte in a case filed against him in Pune in 2020.Sadawarte was accused of abusing a certain class of people during a televised debate on a news channel about the Maratha reservation in October 2020. A viewer in Pune lodged a complaint, and a similar complaint was registered in Satara as well.Sadawarte had been arrested in connection with the Satara case, and the Pune police wanted to question him while he was still in custody. However, Sadawarte's lawyer, Niranjan Mundargi, argued in court that he could not be detained twice for the same offence as it would amount to double jeopardy.Mundargi emphasised that Sadawarte had already been thoroughly investigated and that nothing remained to be discovered.Aruna Pai, the government's pleader, argued that in the Pune case, Sadawarte was served with a 41A summons but did not cooperate. He was called in to provide a voice sample, but he did not show up. Sadawarte has a habit of making explosive statements that he is likely to repeat. His speeches create disharmony in society, said the prosecution.READ | Bombay HC rejects plea seeking transfer of case against Maharashtra minister Jitendra Awhad to CBIAfter hearing arguments from both sides, Justice Vinay Joshi stated that ""a serious question arises, whether a person can be prosecuted more than once for the same act.""The judge had asked Pai to address the issue but stated, ""I did not get a convincing explanation on this point as to how this is in accordance with law. The applicant was initially arrested by Gaodevi police station. Then he was transferred to the Satara case and since then he has been in Magistrate's custody. ""The judge noted that it is ""undisputed that for the same allegation, he has faced custodial interrogation. It is pertinent to know that the FIR was lodged in 2020 and after 6 months, the 41A notice was issued to him.""Justice Joshi said, ""One cannot expect repercussions after a long passage of time. From the bail order passed by the sessions court, it is clear that police have recorded statements of material witnesses. Only a voice sample remains to be obtained.""READ | Mumbai court grants bail to lawyer, 115 others in MSRTC strike caseThe bench added, ""In order to constitute the offence of promoting enmity between classes, particularly to constitute the act as a deliberate one, hurting religious feelings requires adequate mens rea. It is only during trial that mens rea can be determined. The maximum punishment is up to three years in prison. He is a practicing lawyer, and he can be protected by putting terms.""With this, the bench asked Sadawarte to appear before the investigation officer on May 4, 5, and 6 and cooperate with the probe.The court said that in the event of arrest, the applicant should be released on bail on furnishing a personal bond of Rs 25,000 and sureties and with a condition that he should not commit a similar type of offence in the future.Sadawarte was charged with inciting striking Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation employees to attack Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar's residence. Sadawarte was arrested in this case by the Gaodevi police station in Mumbai. However, he had obtained bail in the case from the Mumbai sessions court and walked out of the Arthur Road prison this evening.READ | Hanuman Chalisa row: Rana couple to stay in jail till April 29 as court says 'packed with bail pleas'",2022-04-26,"Bombay High Court grants anticipatory bail to lawyer Gunratan Sadawarte in Pune FIRThe Bombay High Court on Tuesday granted anticipatory bail to Mumbai-based lawyer Gunratan Sadarwarte in a case filed against him in Pune in 2020.Sadawarte was accused of abusing a certain class of people during a televised debate on a news channel about the Maratha reservation in October 2020.

179,180,Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann slams opposition for criticising MoU with Delhi,"Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday lashed out at the opposition parties, asking them to desist from issuing unfounded, illogical, frivolous and politically motivated statements criticising the AAP government’s recent landmark decisions.In a video message, Bhagwant Mann chided the Shiromani Akali Dal President Sukhbir Singh Badal for unleashing propaganda against the state government’s recent initiatives to rejuvenate the health and education sectors on Delhi model.Advising Sukhbir Badal, the CM said,”Healthy criticism is always welcomed but criticism for the sake of just criticism and political survival is highly deplorable.”Bhagwant Mann said the Akali Dal leadership was bereft of any constructive political agenda and hell bent on tarnishing AAP's image, which was voted to power with a thumping majority, thus decimating both Akali Dal and Congress parties from the Punjab polity.Bhagwant Mann rued that Akali Dal was making unnecessary hue and cry over the ‘Knowledge Sharing Agreement’ (KSA) in the field of Health & Education with the Delhi government.“Had the Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal, which ruled Punjab for 44 years, done something tangible for the welfare of the people and prosperity of the state, they would not have to face such humiliation"", he said.Further, Bhagwant said Sukhbir Badal should have patience at least for some time as AAP government had not completed its 44 days while the Congress remained in power for long period of over 25 years and Akali Dal ruled for 19 years.""Sukhbir Badal should not mislead the people by referring to false documents with regard to the KSA besides befooling the people spreading canards about Punjab’s AAP government being run from Delhi"", the CM said, adding that Sukhbir Badal had gone to China to forge a collaboration for power generation from paddy straw and his father Parkash Singh Badal had entered into several agreements in different fields with Ontario province of Canada. He questioned Sukhbir whether their government is run by the Chinese government or Ontario province.Read | AAP MLA welcomes Punjab govt’s decision to withdraw arrest warrants against farmersTaking MLA Partap Singh Bajwa to cudgels, the CM asked him to refrain from baseless accusations for sake of political bashing and reminded him the time when their party’s former chief minister was ordering posting and transfers of high-ups like Chief Secretary, DGP and senior bureaucrat at the instance of his foreign guest.“You were writing letters to the Chief Minister at that time showing displeasure over his autocratic style of functioning but later you too was seen having lunch and dinner with him”, the CM reminded Bajwa.Training guns at Navjot Sidhu, the CM said that first of all Sidhu should get his group recognised by the Congress Party, which was protesting against the power agreements at Rajpura and blaming AAP for the same.
