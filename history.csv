U13740," Palm oil export ban by Indonesia begins tomorrow | All you need to know  Indonesia, the world's top palm oil producer, will ban exports of refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) palm olein, which are made by crushing palm fruit and processing it to remove impurities. The ban is set to begin on Thursday.President Joko Widodo announced the ban on Friday to help lower soaring domestic prices.Palm oil is used in everything from cakes, chocolate, margarine and frying fats to cosmetics, soap, shampoo and cleaning products.Small palm oil planters in Indonesia have enjoyed big paycheques in the past year as global vegetable oil prices surged, but these farmers fear they will bear the brunt of the pain from a new export ban coming into effect on Thursday.Local farmers said prices of fresh palm fruit bunches have already plunged in Kampar, Riau Province on Sumatra island, Reuters reported.Indonesia's ban on palm oil exports is unlikely to last more than a month as Jakarta has limited infrastructure to store the surplus oil and the country faces mounting pressure from buyers to resume shipments, industry officials in Indonesia were quoted as saying by Reuters.The shock move has lifted prices of all edible oils and sowed confusion and alarm among palm oil exporters and consumers alike.However, the stock market panic subsided after officials told palm oil executives the ban will only apply to exports of refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) palm olein, and would not affect flows of crude palm oil or other forms of derivative products.However, Jakarta will widen the ban ""if there is a shortage of refined palm oil,"" according to a presentation the government gave to companies on Monday. RBD palm olein accounts for around 40% of Indonesia's total exports of palm oil products, according to analysts' estimates.Indonesia meets nearly 50 per cent of the total palm oil requirement in India annually.India consumes 22.5 million tonne of edible oil annually, of which 9-9.5 million tonne is met by domestic supplies and the rest by imports. About 3.5-4 million tonne of palm oil is imported by India annually from Indonesia, as per a PTI report.ALSO READ | Palm oil price to go up? Impact of export ban by Indonesia in India"

U13740," Broke 3-4 remote controls at hotel room: Ponting on 'frustrating' isolation  Delhi Capitals head coach Ricky Ponting said he is relieved and excited again to be back after completing the 5-day isolation as the team heads into the second half of Indian Premier League 2022. Ponting was forced to miss the match against Delhi Capitals on Friday, April 22 after one of his family members tested positive for Covid-19.Delhi Capitals confirmed that Ricky Ponting tested negative for Covid-19 but he was isolated as a precautionary measure.Recalling the time away from the game, Ponting said it was a frustrating experience, not being able to be on the sidelines and shout instructions to the team when they lost a last-over thriller to the Rajasthan Royals. The Australian tactician said he broke a couple of television remotes at the hotel room, venting out his frustration.""It's nice to be back outside again. Frustrating (not to travel with the team). I broke 3-4 remote controls.3 or 4 bottles of water might have got thrown into the wall,"" Ponting told Delhi Capitals.""When you are on the sidelines being a coach and you can't control what's happening in the middle, that's hard enough. When you are not on the sidelines, and sending text messages every over, saying 'do this, do that, do this'. It got a little more frustrating,"" he added.Delhi Capitals began their campaign well by beating Mumbai Indians but they have lacked the consistency that vaulted them to the play-offs in the last 2 seasons. Delhi have not managed to stich two successive victories even once in the season.Ponting said he thought Delhi would gather a winning run after their dominant 9-wicket win over Punjab Kings on April 20 but they lost to Rajasthan Royals by 15 runs in a high-scorig match.With Ponting not at the dug-out, tempers flared as Rishabh Pant got assistant coach Pravin Amre to storm onto the pitch and contest the on-field umpire's call over waist-high fulltoss during a tense final over.""I've said it a few times this year where there's 36 or 37 overs of really good stuff, and we just let it slip for two or three overs. And, that's the difference in these games,"" Ponting added.""We sort of gear ourselves to not overtrain in the first part of the season, try and build up along the way. But our performances have been win one, lose one, win one. So, we need to start getting that little bit of momentum.""""Our performances have been win one, lose win. After our win against the Kings, I thought the momentum would have been going our away. It didn't happen in the last game. We are so close to turnin it around.""We've all got to trust, we've got to believe, we've got to stay upbeat and positive. And if we are, things will definitely change for us."""
U13740," Lot of people are praying for my downfall: Osaka thanks her fans for backing amidst mental struggles   Japanese tennis prodigy Naomi Osaka thanked her fans for the immense support they have shown during her challenges over the last few months. Back in September 2021, the 24-year-old decided to take a break from the sport after the shock defeat in the US Open final at the hands of Canadian 18-year-old Leylah Fernandez 5-7, 7-6 (2), 6-4.Last year, in May, Osaka withdrew from the French Open after she was fined and warned for not attending a press conference. The youngster also said that there are a number of people who don’t want her to scale heights in her career.Osaka took to Twitter and wrote, ""Lol I just want to say if you fw me thank you. Tbh there’s probably a lot of people praying on my downfall but I don’t really feel it cause the love overpowers everything. Thank you.”Lol I just want to say if you fw me thank you.

Thank youEarlier this month, Osaka finished as the runner-up in the Miami Open after losing to Poland’s Iga Natalia Swiatek 4-6, 0-6. Back in January, Osaka dropped to No. 85 in the WTA singles world rankings. Prior to the 2022 Australian Open, Osaka was ranked 14, but she dropped 71 spots after her third-round loss to America’s Amanda Anisimova 4-6, 6-3, 7-6 (5).While being in Miami, Osaka talked about consulting a therapist to take care of her mental health. She said that her therapist formulated some strategies for her to apply during challenging circumstances.""Yeah, so -- hmm. I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, but I finally started talking to a therapist after Indian Wells. It only took like a year after the French Open,” she said.Back in January 2019, Osaka became the World No.1 for the first time in her career. After going down in the rankings, the Japanese star is looking forward to climbing the ladder and has set her goals clear for 2022.""I think by next year or by the end of this year, I would love to be in the Top 10,"" Osaka added.

U13740," If need be, I will bowl: Hardik cagey about bowling plans after injury scare  Hardik Pandya on Wednesday said he is not going to risk bowling for Gujarat Titans unless and until the need arises, hinting he will use a restrained approach after the injury scare in IPL 2022 last week. Hardik said Gujarat have plenty of bowling options and it's not necessary to push himself.Hardik Pandya began the IPL 2022 season, bowling full tilt for his new franchise. The star all-rounder had headed into the new season as the captain of Gujarat Titans without any competitive action under his belt. Hardik had taken a lengthy break to recover from recurring back injuries after the T20 World Cup in the UAE in 2021.IPL 2022, GT vs SRH Live UpdatesHardik had bowled for Mumbai Indians in IPL 2021 and has not bowled consistently for India over the last 2 years. Questions were asked about his place in the side but the Baroda all-rounder came out all guns blazing, contributing with both bat and ball for Gujarat.However, Hardik missed the game against Chennai Super Kings last week, giving rise to speculation of injury concern. However, he played down any injury issue after coming back to lead Gujarat against Kolkata Knight Riders over the weekend, saying he took a break as a precautionary measure. Notably, Hardik had bowled only 2.3 overs against Rajasthan Royals after hitting a match-winning 87.Asked if he would bowl on Wednesday against SRH, Hardik said: ""I have to see.""""The kind of attack we are playing I can afford to take it easy. If need be, I will bowl, otherwise I will opt out.""Hardik has bowled 111 deliveries in IPL 2022 and has picked up 4 wickets at an impressive economy rate of less than 8 runs per over. Hardik had consistently clocked in excess of 135 kph but the all-rounder wants to be cautious as he gears up for a likely return to the senior national team after impressing in the new season.Hardik, as Gujarat head coach Ashish Nehra said before the tournament, has proved his mettle as a batter, hitting 295 runs in 6 matches, including 3 fifties."
