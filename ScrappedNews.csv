2,5 bollywood couples with huge age difference,"When there is love, age is but just a number. This is clearly the case with the latest Bollywood celebrities tying the knot - Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor, who have 10 years age gap between them. The much-in-love couple is getting married today, April 14. Ahead of that, here’s a look at five other B-Town pairs who don’t give the gap much of a thought either.Lovebirds Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt are all set to begin a new phase of their life as husband and wife. The two have been in a relationship for five years and their love story is one for the books and screen. Ranbir was Alia’s pehla pyaar and now the two are madly in love with each other. They have a 10-year age difference between them, but that hasn't affect them. Alia was just eleven years old when she started liking Ranbir. The 11-year-old Alia had auditioned for Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s 2005 film, Black. This is where she met Ranbir, who was working as an assistant director for Sanjay.Katrina Kaif is 38 and she is married Vicky Kaushal, 33. The couple’s five-year age gap definitely didn’t come in the way of their wedding. The duo tied the knot on December 9 at Six Senses Fort in Barwara, Sawai Madhopur. Theirs was a very private affair with only close family and friends in attendance. Ever since their wedding, Katrina and Vicky have impressed fans with their chemistry.Priyanka Chopra is elder to husband Nick Jonas by 10 years. On December 1, 2021, Priyanka and Nick celebrated their three-year anniversary. The couple tied the knot in 2018. When the couple had announced their engagement, social media users were quick to point out the age difference between the pair. However, the Jee Le Zaara actress takes every mockery of her age gap with Nick in a positive stride.Saif Ali Khan was married to actress Amrita Singh for 13 years, before calling it quits in 2004. The couple tied the knot in 1991 and shared a 12-year age difference (Singh being older). They have two children together, Sara Ali Khan and Ibrahim Ali Khan. Later, Saif, 51, started dating Kareena Kapoor, 41, in 2007 and got married five years later. The couple have a 10-year age difference. They have been married for 10 years now and have two adorable kids, Taimur and Jeh.Aishwarya was 34 when she married Abhishek, 31, in 2007. The couple has been married for almost 13 years now and is parents to the aww-dorable Aaradhya Bachchan. Abhishek and Aishwarya met for the first time in 1999 for a photoshoot of their first film together - Dhaai Akshar Prem Ke (which released in 2000). “It was our first film together, and I expected a diva. Instead, she was disarmingly wonderful,” Abhishek had said in an interview. The couple liked each other's company and remained friends after the film's release.Other Bollywood couples who have an age gap between them include Shahid Kapoor-Mira Rajput (13 years), Milind Soman and Ankita Konwar (26 years), and Sanjay Dutt and Manyata (19 years) among others.",2022-04-14
3,Gujarat Congress to call on Hardik Patel over his statement on party 'insulting Patidars' and Naresh Patel,"Gujarat Congress president Jagdish Thakor said party leaders are set to call on Hardik Patel over his statement on Patidars and Khodaldham Trust president Naresh Patel.Jagdish Thakor said, ""We have seen statements given by Hardik Patel in the media. We will call Hardik Patel to the party office and discuss the whole matter with him. We will try to understand what the issues are. Only after that, will we be able to speak further.""On Wednesday, Hardik Patel came down heavily on his party, saying that Patidars and Khodaldham Trust president Naresh Patel were being insulted. Hardik Patel said, ""Patidar helped Congress win good numbers in the 2017 elections. Now, the Congress is insulting the same Patidars and Khodaldham Trust president, Naresh Patel.""""In the last two years, we have heard so much about Naresh Patel joining politics. Why is the party taking so much time to make the decision? Why is Congress insulting Naresh Patel and the Patidars? Is it so difficult to make this decision?"" Hardik Patel said.While speaking to India Today, Hardik Patel said that despite being the Congress Working President in Gujarat, he was not even considered or asked while taking important decisions.ALSO READ: Blow to Hardik Patel's poll hopes, SC says no to urgent hearing on conviction in rioting caseA day after getting relief from the Supreme Court, Hardik Patel even showed interest in contesting elections.

4,Kanchipuram Labour Court resumes hearing case by TCS employee who accused boss of sexual assault in 2018,"An appeal against Tata Consultancy Services’s (TCS) ICC (Internal Compaints Committee) report in a sexual harrassment case has been resumed in the Kanchipuram Labour Court in Tamil Nadu.A techie had alleged that she was sexually harassed by her boss in March 2018 in the UK, just before her nine-month assignment ended, and as she prepared to return to India.The woman claimed that the ICC did not give her the boss’s deposition, while her statements on his contradictions were not taken seriously. She also wasn’t allowed the support of a social worker to confront the accused.The victim said “The ICC team, including the chairperson and their report, is biased and prejudiced in favour of the perpetrator.The All India Forum For IT Employees (AIFITE) took up the issue of the sexual harassment case against the IT major’s unfair ICC report. The case has been pending in the Kancheepuram Labour Court for more than two years.The AIFITE also requested the government for a mechanism to monitor the functioning of ICC in all software companies and the implementation of the Vishaka Commission’s recommendations.“AIFITE is standing with the affected employee to get justice from the beginning. But FITE feels that delayed justice is equal to denied justice. The govt(s) should support the affected women employees who are fighting a long way to get justice,” said a statement by the organisation.However, as courts returned to normalcy after being closed due to the spread of Covid-19, the hearing is being delayed by the second respondent, who is also the alleged harasser.During the hearing on March 7, the second respondent and his counsel were absent. As a result, the case was postponed to March 23. On that day, his lawyer appeared and asked for more time.The case was then postponed to April 5. Once again, the alleged harasser’s counsel borrowed more time.It is the second respondent, a.k.a, the alleged harasser, who is causing delays by filing one interim application after another. He had deliberately omitted 9 pages in the first interim application and the court had made another interim application for the submission of those 9 pages.",2022-04-14
5,"With months left for Gujarat Assembly polls, Congress struggles to formulate a cogent strategy","There is utter confusion and disquiet in the Gujarat Congress. Gujarat state unit working president Hardik Patel, a centrepiece of the 2017 Assembly polls, is said to be miffed with the Congress high command. There is no sign of Naresh Patel, an influential Patidar community leader and chairman of Gujarat’s Shree Khodaldham Trust which manages the grand temple of Goddess Khodiyar. A section of the Gujarat Congress has doubts over Naresh Patel leading them from the front. In private, many Congress regional satraps consider Naresh Patel as a politically ‘slippery’ character. Naresh Patel is reportedly being wooed by all sides, including the BJP and Aam Aadmi Party.With barely six months to go for the crucial state Assembly polls, the Congress is struggling to put a cogent electoral strategy in place. Unlike its 2017 election campaign, the Congress seems struggling to showcase its state leadership, talking points, and alliances in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state where the BJP has been in power since 1995.ALSO READ | Will win 58 seats if elections happen today, says AAP Gujarat in-chargeBharatsinh Solanki, Arjun Modhwadia, Shakti Sinh Gohil, Jagdish Thakor, Sukhram Rathva, and other state Congress leaders have been advocating ace poll strategist Prashant Kishor’s involvement in the state Assembly polls but ‘PK’, as he is fondly called, is unwilling to oblige. The talks between Prashant Kishor and the Congress have been going on for months now but a formal induction of a ‘politician’, Prashant Kishor, has not taken place.Five years ago, Rahul Gandhi, vice-president of the AICC then, had acted in a far more decisive manner. He had consciously opted for a high-risk campaign in Gujarat in spite of knowing he was pitted against a formidable foe. The game plan was to somehow pitch himself at par with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Rahul was partially successful in doing so then.ALSO READ | Prashant KishorCongress talks on but Gujarat Assembly election not on agendaThe script of Rahul's ""go all out on Gujarat"" for 2017 was readied by technocrat Sam Pitroda. He had reportedly prepared a paper, highlighting how the state had the potential to change. Next, Rahul was seen holding parleys with lower and middle rung Congress leaders from Gujarat.Throughout the 2017 campaign, Rahul had accorded top priority to Gujarat, camping, and campaigning in the state every week. He received a good crowd and response, harping on the theme of economic slowdown, lack of job opportunities, teething problems over GST implementation, and after-effects of demonetisation.Rahul had roped in a galaxy of party leaders, including Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Rajiv Satav, and the backhand support of Ahmed Patel. In 2022, Congress is counting on Raghu Sharma, former health minister of Rajasthan, to strategise Gujarat polls. Both Satav and Ahmed Patel died during the Covid pandemic in 2020-21.ALSO READ | Eye on Gujarat polls, govt makes donations to Somnath Temple tax-freeThe outcome of the 2017 Assembly polls was in favour of the BJP winning 99 seats in the House of 182. Subsequently, the Congress tally of 77 fell to 65 due to defections and defeat in by-polls.Hardik Patel, who had shot to fame in August 2015 for leading a massive Patidar reservation stir in Gujarat and is currently state Congress vice-president, has made his unhappiness obvious. In an interview with a national daily, Hardik accused the Congress of “ignoring” him and remarked, “My position in the party is that of a newly married groom who has been made to undergo nasbandi (vasectomy).”Without mincing words, Hardik questioned the AICC [read Sonia and Rahul Gandhi] decision to induct 75 new state-level general secretaries and 25 new vice-presidents into the Gujarat Pradesh Congress Committee (GPCC) without consulting him. “I am not invited to any of the meetings of the PCC, they don’t consult me before making any decisions, then what is the point of this post?” said Hardik.The current political situation in Gujarat is remarkably different from 2017. The BJP has a far younger and more vibrant ministry under Bhupendrabhai Patel as compared to the tardy Vijay Rupani regime of 2017. The Aam Aadmi Party is trying to make big inroads in Gujarat. As per one estimate, the AAP is likely to eat into at least 10 to 15 per cent of votes belonging to Congress.ALSO READ | Ahead of Gujarat Assembly polls, govt picks up pace on bullet train projectIn terms of communication, Rahul and Congress thrust on the use of Hindi in Gujarat polls is another area of concern, say Congress insiders. Gujarat is a strong language-driven market where oratory skills in Hindi and English are not at a premium. In fact, anyone attacking Modi in a language other than Gujarati has the potential of being misunderstood or helping Modi turn the tables.In sum and substance, this time around, Rahul needs to de-link Gujarat Assembly polls with Modi and try to exploit local issues ranging from poor governance, traders’ hardship, inadequate representation of castes in reservations, atrocities against Dalits, and other regional issues. Rahul needs to deploy party leaders and spokespersons who are well-versed in the Gujarati language and style of communication to attract a large number of floating voters. It must be borne in mind that floating votes are most likely to get swayed by last-minute emotive issues that may lack substance but are high on emotions and fall prey to the trap of polarisation.(This article is authored by Rasheed Kidwai who is a journalist and author of 24 Akbar Road and Sonia: A Biography)",2022-04-14

34,Rohit Sharma rewards Suryakumar for his performance against PBKS,"Suryakumar Yadav has been in stupendous form in recent times, although his team, Mumbai Indians (MI), have strained to find their feet in the 2022 Indian Premier League (IPL). After returning from an injury layoff, the right-hander has struck form right from the word go. Despite missing MI's first two matches in the tournament, he is their second-highest run-scorer.Yadav has notched 163 runs in three games at an average of 81.50 and a strike rate of 158.25. After getting two back-to-back fifties against the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), he churned out a handy performance against the Punjab Kings (PBKS) as well. On Wednesday, April 13, Yadav scored 43 off 30 balls with one four and four sixes.Until he was there in the middle with the bat at the MCA Stadium, MI had a decent chance of chasing down 198. But once he holed out to Odean Smith off Kagiso Rabada in the penultimate over of the run-chase, the Mumbai-based team went down the hill briskly. With their fifth defeat in a row, Rohit Sharma and Co. stayed at the bottom of the points table.Skipper Rohit, in the meantime, didn't forget to reward Yadav although the latter's knock came in a losing cause. Mayank Agarwal won the official Player of the Match award for his 32-ball 52 and taking two important catches. But the 34-year-old Rohit gave Suryakumar a POTM badge inside the MI dressing room.Yadav walked up to his skipper, who attached a badge to his jersey. The official Instagram handle of the five-time IPL champions posted a video of the same on social media.

36,IPL 2022 | Is this the end of the road for Mumbai Indians?,"Mumbai Indians are slow starters, and there is no escaping that fact even in the 15th edition of the Indian Premier League. However, this year’s been a little different.Mumbai Indians have equalled their worst start in the tournament and you would have to go way back to 2014 to find a Mumbai side this hapless. 5 losses in a trot, one of the worst run-leaking machines in the 10-team mega season and an unsettled XI, non-performing senior players; Mumbai are currently dealing with a huge stack of problems.However, they are after all Mumbai Indians. Back in 2014, Mumbai won seven out of their remaining nine matches to storm into the playoffs, only to be beaten by Chennai Super Kings. But they reached the playoffs nonetheless.Can Mumbai repeat that magic? Do they have enough firepower in their gut to stage another comeback? The questions loom large.After their loss against Punjab Kings, head coach Mahela Jayawardene was found ruing the lack of Jofra Archer in this line-up.""...obviously, one of the best bowlers that we've bought in the auction is Jof (Jofra Archer) Jof is not here. So it is tough when you are in that kind of situation, but we are trying to see how best we can manage,”said the Sri Lankan.The inclusion of Archer solves a lot of problems for Indians. A big hitter at #8 after Kieron Pollard, a furious enforcer with the ball throughout the 20 overs but Mumbai cannot escape the fact that they knew very well that Jofra was not going to be available this time around.The team has tried to make do with the likes of Daniel Sams and Tymall Mills, but that has not quite come off. Sams has the second worst (placed 71st out of 72 bowlers) economy rate this season, among players who have bowled at least 4 overs this season. He has been leaking at the rate of 12.63 from three matches, while Mills is placed at 52nd with 9.71 RPO.At the moment, with the likes of Basil Thampi, Jayadev Unadkat in the line-up, bowling seems to be a major point of concern. The fact that Kieron Pollard has bowled just 7 overs in his 5 matches, is baffling, considering he is synonymous with Mumbai’s exploits in the final overs through the years.MI have not come out with anything about any injury, but it would not be long that people start asking about it.Mumbai sacrificed their batting depth against Punjab Kings to keep a check on their poor economy record. It did not help as Mayank Agarwal’s side went on to make the highest total (199) against Mumbai this season, surpassing Rajasthan Royals, 193 from MI’s second game.With a thin batting line-up marshalled by youngsters Dewald Brevis and Tilak Verma, Mumbai were put under immediate pressure after losing both their openers inside five overs. Ishan Kishan has been kept quiet for the most part after his blistering start in the first game and sooner or later the price tag argument will be floated up in the public, if it hasn’t already.Rohit Sharma’s form is concerning for both MI and India but the coach has backed his captain, stating that the prolific opener is hitting the ball very well and it is a matter of time before he converts.Mumbai have a tremendous bench waiting to be given a chance in the line-up. The easiest possible fix for strengthening all departments is to push Fabian Allen into the line-up. Allen is a blistering lower order batsman, can bowl handy off spin and is regarded as one of the best fielders in world cricket. If Pollard is not feeling it at the moment, then a direct swap can be made. But dropping Pollard from a T20 side is as big a call as it gets in world cricket.The second and the more sustainable change is to play Tim David, the Singaporean-Australian cricketer, who is more classical in nature, but has the output of a power hitter. David has one of the best records against spinners in the T20 format and has proved his abilities across the world playing the franchise format.Mumbai Indians are at a stage where they have nothing to lose. For them, this is a good space, a familiar territory where they shine. If it were Chennai Super Kings, they would probably stick with their team and back the players till they get back in form.Mumbai on the other hand are known for their flexibility and their trust on data. Even till a few years back, an off form Rohit Sharma could drop down in the middle order to have in form players a go. That’s one way to go about it, with Suryakumar Yadav batting above Tilak Verma and Brevis, taking in more time to play the anchor role. If that is the case, Mumbai have to include either Fabian Allen or Tim David depending on what they want aside from a strong finisher. Allen obviously offers a 3-D perspective, but David is stronger with the bat.MI have a lot to figure out as matches come thick and fast, and there is no way other than fixing their best XI suiting their strengths. The clear and obvious problem is the lack of depth in the batting order and their run leaking bowling machine that needs someone to rise up to the occasion apart from Jasprit Bumrah.Will Mumbai once again win seven out of nine to storm into the playoffs? That’s for another day, but for now it is about taking one game at a time.",2022-04-14

45,"As inflation rate soars in India, take a look at situation in US, UK, China, Pakistan","Price rises of essential commodities, vegetables, edible oil and petroleum products have hit common people as inflation rate in India skyrocketted in recent times.However, India is not the only country that has been witnessing rising inflation. Developed nations such as the US, the UK, and China are also grappling with spiralling commodity prices. While India's neighbours Pakistan and Sri Lanka are encountering the worst economic crisis, South Korea is also facing the issue of inflation.Price rises and inflation rates raised concerns during the Covid-19 pandemic, but the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has complicated the situation as several countries across the world are facing worsening supply bottlenecks.Retail inflation soared to a 17-month high of 6.95 per cent in March. This is the third consecutive month that inflation remained above the 6 per cent mark. The previous high at 7.61 per cent was recorded in October 2020.The Consumer Price Index (CPI) based inflation rose mainly on account of rising prices of essential food items like 'oils and fats', vegetables and protein-rich items such as 'meat and fish'.Retail inflation tracked by the CPI measures the changes in prices from a retail buyer's perspective.Last week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised the retail inflation target for the current financial year to 5.7 per cent even as it expected the prices of cereals and pulses to soften on prospects of good winter crop harvest. In its earlier policy review in February, the RBI had projected retail inflation to be at 4.5 per cent in 2022-23.""Global food prices along with metal prices have hardened significantly. Economy is grappling with a sharp rise in inflation... Inflation is now projected at 5.7 per cent in 2022-23 with Q1 at 6.3 per cent; Q2 at 5 per cent; Q3 at 5.4 per cent and Q4 at 5.1 per cent,"" RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das said while unveiling the first monetary policy review for the NEW fiscal year.Consumer prices in the UK rose at the fastest pace in 30 years last month, fuelled by soaring prices for household energy and motor fuels, the Associated Press (AP) reported, quoting government statistics agency data.Inflation rate in the UK accelerated to 7 per cent in the 12 months through March, the highest annual rate since March 1992, the Office for National Statistics said. The US Labour Department said that its consumer price index jumped 8.5 per cent last month.The UK faces what economists say will be the biggest drop in living standards since the mid-1950s as rocketing energy costs, rising food prices and tax increases overshadow rising wages.Prices will continue to rise after Britain's energy regulator authorised a 54 per cent increase in gas and electricity bills for millions of households that took effect in April.China's factory-gate and consumer prices rose faster than expected in March as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, persistent supply chain bottlenecks and production snags caused by local Covid flare-ups added to commodity cost pressures, according to a Reuters report.While China's Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 1.5 per cent in March against 0.9 per cent in February, the Producer Price Index (PPI) was at 8.3 per cent in March, Reuters reported.Inflation has soared over the past year at its fastest pace in more than 40 years in the US, with costs for food, gasoline, housing and other necessities squeezing American consumers and wiping out the pay raises that many people have received, according to an AP report.The Labour Department said Tuesday that its consumer price index jumped 8.5 per cent in March from 12 months earlier — the biggest year-over-year increase since December 1981.Prices have been driven up by bottlenecked supply chains, robust consumer demand and disruptions to global food and energy markets worsened by Russia's war against Ukraine.Even before Russia's war further spurred price increases, robust consumer spending, steady pay raises and chronic supply shortages had sent US consumer inflation to its highest level in four decades.In addition, housing costs, which make up about a third of the consumer price index, have escalated, a trend that seems unlikely to reverse anytime soon.Economists point out that as the economy has emerged from the depths of the pandemic, consumers have been gradually broadening their spending beyond goods to include more services.A result is that high inflation, which at first had reflected mainly a shortage of goods — from cars and furniture to electronics and sports equipment — has been emerging in services, too, like travel, health care and entertainment.Pakistan is witnessing political turmoil even as its economic situation continues to deteriorate. Inflation rate was 12.7 per cent in March, up from 12.2 per cent in February 2022.Sri Lanka has plunged into its worst economic crisis that has led to protests across the country and put President Gotabaya Rajapaksa under mounting pressure to resign. Inflation hit 18.7 per cent in March.Several South Asian countries have been grappling with supply bottlenecks leading to rising commodity prices, and vulnerabilities in financial sectors.South Korea's consumer prices rose at their fastest pace in more than a decade in March as the Ukraine war fuelled surging energy and commodity costs. The consumer price index (CPI) for March rose 4.1 per cent from a year earlier, official data showed on Tuesday, the fastest increase since December 2011.ALSO READ | LIC IPO date, price, size details, discounts: All you need to know",2022-04-14

51,Battle over carbon capture as tool to fight climate change,"Polly Glover realized her son had asthma when he was nine months old. Now 26, he carries an inhaler in his pocket whenever he’s out and about in Prairieville, Louisiana, part of Ascension Parish.“He probably needs to leave Ascension quite frankly,” Glover says, but he hasn’t because “this is his home and this is our family and this is our community.”The parish is part of the 85-mile (137-kilometer) span between New Orleans and Baton Rouge officially called the Mississippi River Chemical Corridor, more commonly known as Cancer Alley. The region’s air quality is some of the worst in the United States, and in several places along the corridor, cancer risks are much higher than levels considered acceptable by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.Glover says the air is “terrible” where she lives, but there’s also great biodiversity — osprey, eagles, migratory birds, deer, rabbits, fish and alligators — among the region’s lakes, rivers and wetlands. The environmental advocate has been working for 30 years to preserve the place she’s loved since childhood.That’s why she is wary of anything that might make air quality worse or threaten wildlife — and her biggest fear now is that a $4.5 billion plant designed to capture climate-changing carbon and make clean-burning hydrogen fuel will actually do more harm to the Lake Maurepas basin.The blue hydrogen energy plant is slated to be built and operated by Air Products and Chemicals, a multinational petrochemical company. The company says the plant will capture airborne carbon emissions created during production and put them safely underground — a process called carbon capture and storage.“Sometimes I think people think you’re kind of bubbling this in at the bottom of the lake,” said Simon Moore, vice president of investor relations, corporate relations and sustainability at Air Products. “You know, this is a mile below the Earth’s surface, where the geological formation of the rock has this porous space, which simply absorbs the CO2.”Still, Glover is worried. “I’m not a scientist. I’m a mom who cares,” she said. “We have got to be better stewards of the environment and while reducing carbon emissions is necessary, injecting them into the basin is not the answer.”There are several other carbon capture and storage projects proposed or in the works throughout the U.S., including in Louisiana, Texas, Minnesota, Michigan, Iowa and California. Companies behind them maintain they can successfully remove carbon from the air to reduce pollution, then safely transport and store the carbon underground — or do both.In some cases, oil and gas companies are banking on this new technology to either help build new profit centers, such as plants that make hydrogen, or extend the lifespan of their fossil fuel facilities.Carbon capture and storage projects are gaining traction since Congress approved $3.5 billion for them last year. The Global CCS Institute, a think tank seeking to advance these projects globally, called it the “single largest appropriation of money for CCS in the history of the technology.”In the latest report from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s top scientists said carbon capture and storage technology has to be part of the range of solutions to decarbonize and mitigate climate change. But they said solar and wind energy and electricity storage are improving faster than carbon capture and storage.Opponents of carbon capture and storage maintain the technology is unproven and has been less effective than alternatives such as solar and wind at decarbonizing the energy sector.“Carbon capture is neither workable nor feasible,” said Basav Sen, climate justice policy director for the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank based in Washington, D.C. “It’s merely an excuse for the fossil fuel industry to keep operating the way it does.”A study in late 2020 by researchers from the University of California, San Diego, found over 80% of 39 projects that have sought to commercialize carbon capture and storage ended in failure. The study cited lack of technological readiness as a top factorBut even if the technology was deployed successfully, several critics say the projects would pose threats to the public health of communities long plagued by air and water pollution.First, they said any project that prolongs the lifespan of an existing industrial facility presents additional environmental harm by extending the amount of time it pollutes a community, which the IPCC report confirms.Second, they noted that since carbon capture would require more energy to power the equipment, it would result in more air pollution because the technology can only catch a portion of the carbon emitted by a facility.Howard Herzog, a senior research engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and pioneer of carbon capture and storage technology, disputed this in an interview with the Associated Press. But he acknowledged there is a risk in transporting and storing carbon.In 2020, a pipeline carrying compressed carbon dioxide ruptured in the town of Satartia, Mississippi, which caused over 40 people to get hospital treatment and more than 300 to evacuate. The incident is cited by experts, advocates and residents who live near proposed carbon capture and storage projects to illustrate potential dangers of transporting carbon long distances.Injecting carbon underground for storage could end up contaminating aquifers, according to Nikki Reisch, director of the climate and energy program for the Center for International Environmental Law.Over 500 environmental organizations, including the law center, signed an open letter published in the Washington Post in July 2021, calling carbon capture and storage a “false solution.”In response, the Carbon Capture Coalition, which advocates the technology, released its own letter in August with over 100 signatories. They pressed Congress to include investment in carbon capture and storage in any upcoming legislation.Matt Fry, a state and regional policy manager with the Great Plains Institute, a Minneapolis-based climate and energy think tank, told AP the technology is essential to meeting mid-century climate goals.“The potential for a completely decarbonized, electrified world is a reality,” Fry said. “But we’re going to need to transition to get there. And it’s going to require carbon capture to address those emissions.”At the point of capture, Herzog said, the technology poses a “very low” threat to public health. “There’s always a chance of some mishaps,” he added, “but on the overall scale of chemical plants, (the technology) is fairly benign.”Still, residents near proposed projects worry.In California’s Central Valley agricultural region, Chevron, Microsoft and Schlumberger New Energy are collaborating to build a facility in the town of Mendota that will create energy by converting agricultural waste into carbon monoxide and hydrogen gas, then mixing it with oxygen to generate electricity with the promise of capturing 99% of the carbon from the process.Chevron said it plans to inject the carbon “underground into nearby deep geologic formations.”That’s concerning for Nayamin Martinez, who lives in the valley and is director of the Central California Environmental Justice Network. “That worries us a lot,” she said. “What does that mean in terms of risk for contamination of drinking water?”Creighton Welch, a spokesperson for Chevron, said the process they plan to use is safe. “CO2 capture, injection, and storage are not new technologies and have been conducted safely for decades,” Welch said.Back in Louisiana, Glover and other residents also fear carbon capture technology will affect the water. The carbon dioxide captured at the Air Products and Chemicals facility will be stored in sites such as under Lake Maurepas, an important wetland.Kim Coates, who lives on the lake’s northeast side, said it’s a buffer between the Gulf of Mexico and residents. But she said she’s witnessed generations of destruction to that ecosystem through industrial development and, more recently, hurricanes and tropical storms.Now Coates fears more of the same if carbon is stored under the lake. “We’ve seen the destruction over time with no one looking forward to what was going to happen in the future,” she said.",2022-04-14

58,Scientists find ancestor of supermassive black hole from dawn of the universe,"Scientists studying the origin of the universe have for the first time discovered the ancestor of a supermassive black hole, which has properties that lie in-between those of a galaxy and a quasar (objects powered by black holes a billion times as massive as our sun).Astrophysicists from the Niels Bohr Institute, University of Copenhagen, and the Technical University of Denmark revealed that the object was born 750 million years after the Big Bang and since the Big Bang occurred about 13.8 billion years ago, the origins of this object are from an epoch known as “Cosmic Dawn”.The findings have been published in the journal Nature and state that understanding how supermassive black holes form and grow in the early universe has become a major challenge since it was discovered that luminous quasars existed only 700 million years after the Big Bang.According to Nasa, supermassive black holes, which are millions, if not billions, of times as massive as the Sun, lie at the center of virtually all large galaxies.Dubbed GNz7q, the object is located in a galaxy that is forming stars 1,600 times faster than our own galaxy, the Milky Way. The stars, in turn, create and heat cosmic dust, making it glow in the infrared to the extent that GNz7q’s host is more luminous in dust emission than any other known object at this period of the Cosmic Dawn.Astronomers found the mysterious object when they scoured data from the Hubble space telescope's observations. They said that the mysterious discovery is linked to a specific type of quasar, that is found in the centers of galaxies and luminous quasars are powered by supermassive black holes, with masses ranging from millions to tens of billions of solar masses.“Understanding how supermassive black holes form and grow in the early universe has become a major mystery. Theorists have predicted that these black holes undergo an early phase of rapid growth: a dust-reddened compact object emerges from a heavily dust-obscured starburst galaxy, then transitions to an unobscured luminous compact object by expelling the surrounding gas and dust,"" Associate Professor Gabriel Brammer, Niels Bohr Institute said.Astronomers said that GNz7q was found at the center of an intensely studied sky field known as the Hubble GOODS North field. Finding GNz7q hiding in plain sight was only possible thanks to the uniquely detailed, multi-wavelength datasets available for GOODS North.The newly discovered object presents the first evidence of the transitioning, rapid growth phase of black holes at the dusty star core.The team is hopeful that with the James Webb Telescope in the final stages of commissioning, it will be possible to observe these mysterious objects in better detail.",2022-04-14

60,"Religious conversion isn’t rampant in TN like BJP claims, says minister | Exclusive","In an exclusive interview with India Today TV, Tamil Nadu State Education Minister, Anbil Mahesh, gave his statement on the recent incident of religious conversion in Kanyakumari. He stated that it was an isolated incident as opposed to the BJP’s claim that religious conversion is rampant in Tamil Nadu.A school teacher was suspended in Kanyakumari after a Class 6 student lodged a complaint against attempts at religious conversion in a government higher secondary school.Talking to reporter Pramod Madhav, the minister said, “We heard the news and we enquired about it. Immediately, we have also taken action from our department’s side. This shouldn’t happen and we don’t know why it did. We have asked for a detailed report of the incident too.”“Based on the first-hand information available, we have suspended the teacher too,” said the State Education minister.When asked about the BJP’s claim that these incidents are continuously happening and religious conversion is rampant in the state, the minister replied, “It is not happening repeatedly. It happened only in this part of Kanyakumari.”“BJP used to talk about the Michael Patti issue. But that is very different. It is not that. Here, we have taken action immediately. This should not happen hereafter. We have (issued) appointment circulars to all govt schools (on) what steps have to be taken,” said minister Anbil Mahesh.Taking to Twitter, Tamil Nadu BJP President, Annamalai, hit out at the DMK government by saying, "" The DMK government wouldn't have bothered about this incident if it had not made the news - Yet again! Suspension of the teacher is not a solution to this, and as we have constantly been emphasising, Anti-forced conversion law is the need of the hour in TN!""Forced conversion, a menace prevalent outside educational institutions, has now infiltrated the classrooms.A class 6 student studying in a government school in Kanyakumari had complained about her teacher’s missionary activities inside the classroom.1/2A Class 6 student in Kanyakumari accused her tailoring teacher of promoting Christianity inside the classroom and attempting religious conversion.One of the students stated that the teacher used to tell them to read the Bible and asked them to join her in prayer after lunch break.“I told her that we don’t read the Bible as we are Hindus and that we read Bhagavad Gita, for which she said that Bhagavad Gita is bad,"" the student said, also accusing the teacher of making objectionable remarks against Hindus.Also Read: Lightning strike kills 6 in Tamil Nadu, CM Stalin announces ex-gratia for kin",2022-04-14

A number of gifts received by him from all over the world but not exhibited so far have been put on display in the renovated Block I,"" an official said.Starting from the country's freedom struggle and the making of the Constitution, the museum tells the story of how India's prime ministers navigated the nation through various challenges and ensured its all-round progress. The guiding principle has been to recognise the contributions of all the prime ministers in a non-partisan manner, the officials said.The design of the museum building is inspired by the story of a rising India, shaped and moulded at the hands of its leaders, they added.The design incorporates sustainable and energy conservation practices. No tree has been felled or transplanted. The total area of the building is 10,491 square metres. The logo of the building represents the hands of the people of India holding the ""chakra"", symbolising the nation and democracy.Information was collected through institutions such as Doordarshan, Film Division, Sansad TV, Ministry of Defence, media houses (Indian and foreign), print media, foreign news agencies, the ""Toshakhana"" of the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) etc. The families of the former prime ministers were also contacted for valuable information about them.The content has been acquired on a perpetual licence in most cases. Appropriate use of archives (collected works and other literary works, important correspondences), personal items, gifts and memorabilia (felicitations, honours, medals conferred, commemorative stamps, coins etc.), speeches of the prime ministers, anecdotal representation of their ideologies and different aspects of their lives have been reflected in a thematic format.The Pradhanmantri Sangrahalaya has employed cutting-edge technology-based interfaces to present information in an easy and interesting manner, especially for youngsters. Holograms, virtual reality, augmented reality, multi-touch, multi-media, interactive kiosks, computerised kinetic sculptures, smartphone applications, interactive screens, experiential installations etc. have been leveraged to make the exhibition content highly interactive.(With inputs from PTI)",2022-04-14
64,Odean Smith redeems himself with 3 wickets in last 5 days after 2 sixes off last 2 balls,"A career economy rate of 9.45 isn’t quite the right number, especially when it’s about bowling death overs. It showed when a certain bowler, named Odean Smith, failed to defend 19 runs on a Friday night. After being asked to defend those many runs, the pacer dished out juicy half-volleys and a certain Rahul Tewatia took him to the cleaners.Rajasthan Royals (RR) had managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat against the Punjab Kings (PBKS). In his maiden Indian Premier League (IPL) season for the Kings, Smith learned a lesson the hard way. Rahul Tewatia isn’t the most orthodox batter one would come across, but he is mightily effective.Tewatia almost swept Smith for a six the other night to take PBKS home. In fact, with 12 to get off two balls, the southpaw took his team home. After getting hit for a six on the penultimate ball, Smith tried to bowl away from Tewatia’s hitting arc, but the batter was equal to the task.It was pretty evident that skipper Mayank Agarwal wouldn’t trust Smith with the responsibility to bowl the final over again. However, the captain showed faith in the West Indies pacer and here Smith was, again bowling the final over of an innings, this time against the Mumbai Indians (MI).This time around, Smith had to face the likes of Jaydev Unadkat and Murugan Ashwin, who aren’t as strong opponents as Tewatia. But Smith seemed still reeling from the horror show as Unadkat pulled him over the square leg region for a colossal six.Unadkat has the reputation of hitting the ball a fair distance and the game was well within MI's reach. The ghosts of the Brabourne seemed to haunt Smith in Pune. But this time around, instead of crumbling under pressure, the pacer showed nerves of steel.In the last four balls of MI’s run-chase on Wednesday at the MCA Stadium, Smith gave away only one run and picked up three wickets. Unadkat, Jasprit Bumrah and Tymal Mills threw their bats only to get caught. Smith finished with four wickets in the match on April 13.PBKS secured their third win out of five games and Smith would have heaved a sigh of relief. After the game, the 25-year-old credited the seasoned Shikhar Dhawan for guiding him with the appropriate inputs in the crunch moments.“I was thinking it was such a coincidence that within four games I found myself in the same situation. What doesn't kill me makes you stronger. I just went out there and backed my best balls and it came through for us. [On coming around the wicket] Most of the guys hit the ball straight or leg side.""I talked to Shikhar and he said this guy doesn't cut the ball or scoop anything. I thought it would be harder for him to get me straight down the ground or through the leg side if I was going across him,"" Smith said in the post-match presentation ceremony.Although Smith is known more for his unorthodox batting than his bowling, someone who can break Chris Gayle’s bat with sheer pace isn’t the worst with the ball. Smith, without a doubt, gave a glimpse of the damage he could do with the ball against the five-time IPL champions.",2022-04-14

76,James Webb Telescope is shivering in the dark. It's a good thing,"The James Webb Telescope, which is primed to see the first moments right after the Big Bang and find the first clues to our existence, is shivering in the darkness of space as its instruments get super cold. It's a good thing since we need it to be super cold to see the birth of the first galaxies in the universe.The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) onboard the flying observatory attained its final operating temperature below 7 kelvins (-266 degrees Celsius). The key instrument cooled off in the shade of Webb’s tennis-court-size sunshield, dropping to about -183 degrees Celsius.“The MIRI cooler team has poured a lot of hard work into developing the procedure for the pinch point. The team was both excited and nervous going into the critical activity. In the end, it was a textbook execution of the procedure, and the cooler performance is even better than expected,” Analyn Schneider, project manager for MIRI said in a statement.A major reason for the Webb to be this cold is that it has to observe the universe in infrared light, wavelengths slightly longer than those that human eyes can see. While distant galaxies, stars hidden in cocoons of dust, and planets outside our solar system emit infrared light, so do warmer objects, including Webb’s own electronics, which would make the observations overlap and flawed.Nasa said that cooling down the four instruments’ detectors and the surrounding hardware suppresses those infrared emissions and since MIRI detects longer infrared wavelengths than the other three instruments, it needs to be even colder. Meanwhile, the cold temperatures also help in suppressing electric currents created by the vibration of atoms in the detectors themselves giving the false impression that they have been hit by light from an external source.""Those false signals can drown out the real signals astronomers want to find. Since temperature is a measurement of how fast the atoms in the detector are vibrating, reducing the temperature means less vibration, which in turn means less dark current,"" the Webb team said in a statement.Scientists began running diagnostics on MIRI after it reached the desired temperature of -266 degrees Celsius and beamed a series of commands to the telescope to see if it could execute tasks correctly.There are still more challenges that the team will have to face before MIRI can start its scientific mission. Now that the instrument is at operating temperature, team members will take test images of stars and other known objects that can be used for calibration and to check the instrument’s operations and functionality.“We spent years practicing for that moment, running through the commands and the checks that we did on MIRI. “It was kind of like a movie script: Everything we were supposed to do was written down and rehearsed. When the test data rolled in, I was ecstatic to see it looked exactly as expected and that we have a healthy instrument,” Mike Ressler, project scientist for MIRI at JPL said.",2022-04-14

80,"Union Cabinet approves policy to unlock non-minable land, will be used to set up coal infrastructure","The Union Cabinet has approved a policy to unlock dead coal mine land owned by state coal companies. The land will be leased out in order to develop coal and energy infrastructure. State coal companies will continue to own the land.The policy, cleared by the Cabinet on Wednesday, provides for mining land that has run its course to be used for “the purpose of development and setting up of infrastructure relating to coal and energy”.One of the key reasons the government cleared the policy is that these land tracts are prone to unauthorised encroachment. Additionally, coal companies that own the land have to keep spending money on maintenance and security of the land.A senior coal ministry official said, “This will turn land which is a mere financial liability into a source of revenue generation and direct and indirect employment.”Importantly, the ownership of land that is de-coaled or no longer suitable or economically viable for coal mining will not change.A government statement said that state-owned coal companies like Coal India Ltd (CIL) and its subsidiaries will remain the owners of the land acquired under the CBA Act. The new policy allows only leasing of the land for specific purposes.The company that owns the land will lease out the land for only a specific period mandated by the policy.As per the policy, the leased out land will be considered for activities such as setting up coal washeries, conveyor systems, establishing coal-handling plants, constructing railway sidings, rehabilitation and resettlement of project-affected families due to acquisition of land under the CBA Act or other land acquisition laws, setting up thermal and renewal power projects and setting up or providing for coal development-related infrastructure including compensatory afforestation.As per the policy, private capital will be deployed in joint projects to set up this infrastructure.A government statement said that entities for leasing will be selected through a transparent, fair and competitive bidding process to achieve optimal value.According to the statement, the proposal to utilise the land for rehabilitation purpose will ensure proper usage of the land and will eliminate wastage of all-important land resource, avoid acquisition of fresh chunk of land for rehabilitation of project-affected families, eliminate loading of additional financial burden on the projects and increase profit.It will also address the demand of the displaced families as they prefer to stay as close as possible to their original residential places.",2022-04-14

With the latest package of sanctions imposed on Russia by the United Kingdom and the European Union on Wednesday, Putin’s plan to control a 20% share of the global LNG market by 2035 seems to be even harder to achieve.Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday, April 14, that Moscow will be looking into alternative markets for its energy exports after Western capitals sanctioned Russia over its military operation in Ukraine.Click here for the LIVE updates on the Russia Ukraine war.Russia is currently the largest gas exporter, with Europe accounting for more than a third of its market, says the US Energy Information Administration. With the Netherlands deciding to stop pumping oil and gas by 2050 and cutting down on its production last year, Russia emerged as a critical supplier to Europe. The Covid-19 pandemic and the simultaneous lockdown also hit the European and global markets last year, which gave Russia even more sway over Europe.ALSO READ | US to give heavier weapons to Ukraine as Russia plans next assault | Top points on Day 50Russia’s power over the European market was seen when gas prices suddenly dropped in October 2021, following Putin’s comments on stepping in to “stabilize” the energy market.This increase in Russia’s influence in the European market led to the West accusing Putin of trying to score geopolitical points in 2021, a charge that the Kremlin has denied, citing that it only stepped in to fill the void in the gas market. After much deliberation, Russia offered to hold talks with the Western leaders on steps to boost gas supply. He went on to blame Europe for the gas crunch due to a lack of planning.Amid the gas crisis in Europe, Russia had set a target of a 20% share of the gas market by 2035, expanding its annual LNG output to 120 million-140 million tonnes from around 30 million tonnes at present.ALSO READ | India's monthly purchase of Russian oil less than what Europe buys in 1 afternoon: Jaishankar to USThis plan was, however, hit by the EU's fifth package of sanctions against Russia that barred the delivery of goods and technologies required for gas liquefaction.

The EU has set a target to end all Russian fossil fuel imports by 2027.A 2021 study of Russia’s energy exports showed that Moscow exported 74% of its natural gas to the members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in Europe, and 13% each to the Asia and Oceania regions and the rest of the world.WATCH | Of oligarchs and silovarchs: Who are silovarchs and how powerful are they? According to the US Energy Information Administration, “In 2021, Russia was the largest natural gas-exporting country in the world, the second-largest crude oil and condensates-exporting country after Saudi Arabia, and the third-largest coal-exporting country behind Indonesia and Australia. Although OECD Europe received most of Russia’s crude oil and natural gas exports last year, countries in Asia and the Oceania region received most of Russia’s coal exports.”Russia is the world’s third-largest oil producer behind the United States and Saudi Arabia. As the third week of April began, the European Union started drafting proposals to ban the import of oil as part of another sanctions package against Russia. Oil from Moscow forms around a fourth of the EU’s crude imports.Although the plans have not been finalized yet, the sanctions could include higher tariffs on Russian oil and a ban on some oil products, said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.While the United States and the UK have imposed a total ban on Russian oil imports, hoping to cut off a significant source of revenue for Moscow, taking a similar decision is harder for Europe due to its high dependence and could push up the already high energy prices.ALSO READ | Russia will launch lunar probe this year, says Putin amid crippling sanctions from WestThe dilemma is compounded by the geographical spread of the EU and the vastly varying economic capacities of its 27 members.

Soon after the ban announcement, Germany, the EU’s largest economy, was left scrambling for gas and oil to support its industries. In fact, Germany, which is the main importer of coal from Russia, pressured the EU to push back the ban by four months, said sources.The delayed ban on coal imports is being seen as the easiest punitive measure against Russia. The sanction is unlikely to greatly affect either side beyond a few months. While Europe can replace its requirements from other coal producers such as the US or India, Russia’s coal imports to Europe, which comprise only 32% of its total coal imports, is likely to be diverted to the Asia Oceania region, which currently buys 53% of Moscow’s export quota.ALSO READ | Russia war a genocide, Putin trying to wipe out Ukraine, says US President BidenAccording to the EIA, “Russia exported more than half of the coal the country produced in 2021.

102,"Nothing wrong with Rohit Sharma's captaincy, MI bowlers are low on confidence - Swann","Former England cricketer Graeme Swann reckoned there's hardly anything wrong with Rohit Sharma's captaincy despite Mumbai Indians' (MI) dismal run in the 2022 Indian Premier League (IPL). MI, the five-time IPL champions, are tottering at the bottom of the points table, having lost all five of their matches in the ongoing championship.On Wednesday, April 13, Rohit and Co. lost to Mayank Agarwal's Punjab Kings (PBKS) by 12 runs at the MCA Stadium in Pune. Swann, one of the most decorated spinners during his playing days, said it's unfair to criticise the 34-year-old Sharma for MI's poor showing this season.Rather, Swann felt that bowling has let the Mumbai-based team down big time. The veteran said that apart from Jasprit Bumrah's stupendous spell in the middle overs, the MI bowlers were well below par during the match against PBKS.""I am not happy that Rohit Sharma's captaincy is questioned here, at all (97-run opening stand and PBKS scoring 198). I think the bowlers are low on confidence. There is a massive difference between a captain who can throw the ball to his bowlers, who can absolutely hit a length.""Until Jasprit Bumrah came on and bowled a brilliant spell in the middle overs, the Mumbai bowlers were well below-par,"" Swann was quoted as saying.""So do not, for one second, start thinking it's Rohit's fault. Everybody he turned to bowled badly in the first 10 overs. That's how it is,"" he added.After electing to field first, MI struggled as PBKS put up a massive score of 198/5 on the board. Barring Bumrah, the other Mumbai bowlers went for plenty, with Basil Thampi and Jayden Unadkat conceding 91 runs in their combined quota of eight overs.Dewald Brevis, Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav kept MI alive in their run-chase. But after Yadav's dismissal in the penultimate over, the writing was on the wall for Rohit's men.",2022-04-14

104,KGF Chapter 2 Movie Review: Yash and Sanjay Dutt steal the show,"After Allu Arjun's Pushpa and SS Rajamouli's RRR, it's now time for Yash's KGF: Chapter 2 to set your screens on fire. Quite literally. The first part, KGF: Chapter 1, ended on a high note and managed to keep curiosity alive for over 3.5 years. With KGF: Chapter 2's release today (April 14), Yash and director Prashanth Neel have hit it out of the park once again.Raja Krishnappa Bairya AKA Rocky Bhai (Yash) is now the ruler of Kolar Gold Fields (KGF) after killing Garuda. In Prakash Raj's words, Rocky has built an indestructible empire in KGF with his clever thinking and quick wit. As he plans to extend his empire, his enemies take the help of the mighty Adheera (Sanjay Dutt) to finish him. From here, it becomes a battle of machismo. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ramika Sen (Raveena Tandon) fears the meteoric rise of Rocky Bhai. How do they tackle Rocky forms the story.Like Baahubali, Prashanth Neel did a clever job of establishing the characters and plot in the first part. The second part, KGF: Chapter 2, shows the enemies unable to handle Rocky's rise as the messiah of the masses. The sequel has enough meat in terms of story, which comes as a huge advantage. Rocky has only one dream to fulfil and he fears no one and nothing.Prashanth Neel's KGF: Chapter 2 is replete with 'mass' moments not just for Yash but also for Sanjay Dutt. These scenes are aplenty and come at frequent intervals only to get us hyped up for what's about to come. With Sanjay Dutt, Prashanth found a menacing villain, who has an equal weightage as the hero.Be it Rocky's introduction sequence or the climax fight between Yash and Sanjay Dutt, every scene is stylishly shot and grasps us into the world of KGF. However, the downfall of the film is its uneven pacing. Certain sequences featuring Srinidhi Shetty and Yash's flashback sequences bog down the momentum. Hence, the overall pacing gets affected.Yash is flamboyant as Rocky Bhai. It is safe to say that he has breathed life into the role and looks at ease when he mouths the tacky dialogues. He owns them and it totally works. Similarly, Sanjay Dutt's Adheera, who is inspired by the Vikings, strikes fear with his violent activities. Sanjay's performance, even though with less screentime, is effective. Raveena Tandon as the PM of India delivers an earnest performance.Here's the trailer of KGF: Chapter 2:Srinidhi Shetty's role is quite disappointing and problematic. Rocky brings her home as he considers her 'entertainment.' However, he doesn't touch her, because he believes that women and children cannot be touched without consent. Isn't it quite contradicting? Such conflicting ideas makes you question the intention of the character.KGF: Chapter 2's stunt sequences deserve a special mention. They are grand, inventive and do not defy logic in most places. Though Yash and Sanjay Dutt are shown as two invincible men, they do get shot and hurt while pitted against each other.Editor Ujwal Kulkarni's work is sleek in most places. However, the black-out pattern in editing spoils the overall effect in some places. Cinematographer Bhuvan Gowda and Ravi Basrur's music have elevated KGF: Chapter 2 to a different level.KGF: Chapter 2 is an immersive sequel, which has several clap-worthy moments for the audience. The climax is cathartic and brilliantly shot. Watch out for the sequence!3.5 out of 5 stars for KGF: Chapter 2.",2022-04-14

Having had a 2-day break, the Titans will be raring to go today.Gujarat are in 5th spot as 5 teams are tied on 6 points each in the IPL 2022 points table, but a win in Mumbai on Thursday will help them displace the Royals from the numero uno position.It's not going to be easy as Rajasthan have been one of the most well-rounded teams of IPL 2022, having collected 3 wins in 4 matches despite Samson losing tosses.The much-anticipated battle between two of the best pacer attacks, with Lockie Ferguson and Mohammed Shami on GT's side and Trent Boult and Prasidh Krishna in RR's side, is adding to the hype around the contest. It will also be Rashid Khan vs the class of R Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal.Rajasthan Royals: RR are heading into Thursday's contest on the back of a thrilling 3-run win over Lucknow Super Giants.

With spinners getting assistance at DY Patil Stadium, how Gujarat handle Chahal's 4 overs can prove to be decisive.While the Royals will look to retain their winning XI, Gujarat might replace wicketkeeper Matthew Wade who has been struggling to be explosive at the top. Gujarat have an able replacement in Afghanistan's Rahmanullah Gurbaz.Rajasthan Royals: Jos Buttler, Devdutt Padikkal, Sanju Samson (c and wk), Shimron Hetmyer, Riyan Parag, Ravichandran Ashwin, Jimmy Neesham, Navdeep Saini, Trent Boult, Prasidh Krishna, Yuzvendra ChahalGujarat Titans: Rahmanullah Gurbaz (wk), Shubman Gill, Sai Sudharsan, Hardik Pandya (c), David Miller, Rahul Tewatia, Abhinav Manohar, Rashid Khan, Lockie Ferguson, Mohammed Shami, Darshan Nalkande",2022-04-14

Some farmers were also seen making a beeline to get their crop procured at Adani Group's Silo in Moga, the private giant which was targeted by the farmers’ unions last year during the year-long agitation.ALSO READ: Punjab government appeals center to relax norms for shrivelled grains in wheat procurementThe Khanna grain market is said to be the largest grain market in Asia. Harbans Singh Rosha, president of Khanna’s Arhtiya Association, confirms that many private buyers approached them, but a number of them have returned empty-handed as Punjab levies heavy market fees on food grain buyers.""It is an irony that Punjab, despite being the largest wheat producer, is not able to attract many private food grain buyers. They are going back to neighbouring Haryana, where the market fee is negligible. Punjab charges a whopping six per cent market fee as compared to neighbouring Haryana where it is just one percent,"" says Harbans Singh Rosha.Punjab has been criticised by the food grain business owners as the market fee being charged by it adds an additional cost of Rs 120 per quintal.Meanwhile, private buyers are procuring wheat through flour mill owners who have been exempted from paying the market fee.Punjab may miss this year's wheat harvest targets following a shrivelled grain problem caused by the continuous dry spell and rising temperatures.Though almost all Punjab district farmers are facing the shrivelled grain problem, the farmers in Rupnagar, Patiala and Fatehgarh Sahib districts are the worst hit.ALSO READ: Centre extends free foodgrain distribution under PM Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana till September 2022Speaking to India Today, the farmers said that the shrivelled grains will also result in a drop in yield per acre.Normally, farmers get upto 22 quintals per acre, but this year it has been dropped to 13 to 14 quintals. Not only this, the crop this year also matured nearly a month before the actual period. The farmers are expected to harvest their crop by the end of this month, while normally, the harvest season starts from Baisakh (April 13) and lasts till May 15.Meanwhile, acting on the state government's appeal to take stock of the problem, the union government has sent five teams to take stock of the situation at 15 places.""The Punjab government has also appealed to the Central government to allow relaxation in the norms of shrivelled grains without any value cut, since the farmer had already been penalised on account of lower yield. A formal request in this regard had already been made by the State government,”AAP spokesperson Malwinder Singh Kang said.The farmers have already dumped a sizable quantity of wheat in various food grain markets of the state. As per the state government estimates, 14.9 Lakh MT of wheat had arrived in the markets, out of which more than 12 Lakh MT had already been procured.",2022-04-14
123,UP MLC polls: BJP’s grassroot workers key to party’s victory in Agra,"During the run-up to the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, every big and small party leader was trying to get a ticket, but the BJP chose candidates who they were certain could win the election. This made a lot of the party workers dissatisfied, as they were expecting to be given a chance. For the MLC polls, the BJP chose to give importance to the grassroots workers of the party, giving them tickets for the election.The victory of former Agra city BJP president Vijay Shivhare in the polls to the state’s Legislative Council is being seen as a part of that strategy, as Shivhare has always been a grassroot worker of the party.Having joined as a primary worker of the party, Shivhare reached the level of BJP's state secretary, and the Panchayat elections of 2021 were contested by the party under his supervision, which led to the victory of the party in 15 Block and Zila Panchayat Chairman elections.ALSO READ: 3 ministers from Agra inducted to UP Cabinet; confirms India Today predictionsHis continuous efforts ultimately led to a win on all 9 UP assembly seats of Agra in 2022, even though the party did not perform quite as well in other districts of the state.It was due to all these efforts in the party organization, that Shivhare was ultimately rewarded with an MLC ticket, sending a positive signal to the other workers in the party organization.Hindustani Biradari Vice-Chairman Vishal Sharma praised the party's decision to bring forth the grassroot workers and give them better portfolios. He said that the BJP is not just the largest of all parties in the country, but it also has a high level of internal democracy.Social activist Sameer said, “Apart from the BJP, in every party, even the lowest level of party worker starts thinking of himself as a leader. This results in the defeat of that party. On the other hand, in the BJP, even the topmost leaders of the party consider themselves as party workers, and this brings an overall benefit to the party in every election.”",2022-04-14

All of the victims were expected to survive.Tuesday's attack was the latest burst of violence that has plagued the largest U.S. city transit system, and posed a new challenge for Mayor Eric Adams, who has tried to halt declining ridership during the pandemic and ensure public safety.ALSO READ: New York shooting: Man in gas mask fired 33 rounds, say cops | Top pointsJames was apprehended in Manhattan's East Village neighborhood after being spotted by bystanders who posted pictures of him to social media that alerted police, local media reported.Officials were due to hold a news conference on the investigation on Wednesday afternoon.Authorities have not ruled out a motive but said it was not being treated as an act of terrorism and that the suspect acted alone.U-HAUL VANThe New York Police Department (NYPD) says James, who has addresses in Philadelphia and Milwaukee, Wisconsin, left keys to a rented U-Haul van at the crime scene in the 36th Street station, in Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood.Investigators found a number of social media posts linked to an individual named Frank James that mentioned homelessness and Mayor Adams, Sewell said. A YouTube account apparently belonging to James was taken down Wednesday ""for violating YouTube's Community Guidelines,"" the video platform said.ALSO READ: Two Sikh men attacked, robbed in New York, one arrestedAttempts by Reuters to reach any of the phone numbers associated with James were unsuccessful.In an interview with the New York Times, James' sister, Catherine James Robinson, said he had ""been on his own his whole life"" and that she was surprised by the incident.""I don't think he would do anything like that. That's not in his nature to do anything like that,"" she said.NO OTHER OPTIONOn Wednesday morning, with the gunman then still at large, New Yorkers went on with their commuted, saying the violence would not deter them.""It was terrible. I was sad; I had to explain it to my daughter,"" commuter Matthew Mosk said. ""I was lucky I wasn’t on the train because I usually commute around that time.""Another man riding the subway, Nathan Sandidge, said: ""I don't really have any other option. It's what we have to do to get to work. So, just kind of roll with whatever we have to deal with.""Ridership has taken a downturn during the pandemic, dropping from 5.5 million trips per week day to an average of 3.3 million last week. New York has also seen a sharp rise in violent crime, including seemingly random attacks on the subway.The transit violence has included a number of attacks in which passengers were shoved onto train tracks from platforms, including a Manhattan woman whose murder was seen as part of a surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans.After Tuesday's attack, Mayor Adams pledged to double the number of officers assigned to subway security. He has prioritized increasing police patrols and expanding mental health outreach programs to combat violence.The mayor told MSNBC on Wednesday the city was looking at new technologies for metal detectors that would keep people safe while minimizing disruption.""There are new models that are being used at ball games, ballparks, hospitals, where you're not stopping to go through your belongings, you simply walk in through a device,"" Adams said.ALSO READ: Suspected killer of Indian student in Canada arrested: Police",2022-04-14

146,Mumbai Indians slip to new low in IPL after heartbreaking defeat,"As captain Rohit Sharma conceded, nothing is working for Mumbai Indians in IPL 2022. The 5-time champions fell to their 5th straight defeat in the new season, failing to chase 199 against Punjab Kings in Match 22 at the MCA Stadium in Pune on Wednesday, April 13.Mumbai Indians are winless in the 3rd week of IPL 2022 as the most successful IPL franchise slipped to a new low in the T20 league. Rohit Sharma's men became the first team in the history of the tournament to start a season with 5 successive defeats twice.IPL 2022: Full Coverge | Points TableMumbai Indians had begun IPL 2014 on a horror note with 5 consecutive defeats. However, they had qualified for the play-offs in that season. It's not wise to rule out a similar comeback from MI this season but if early signs are anything to go by, Mumbai lack the quality that defined them ever since Rohit took over the leadership role in 2013.IPL 2022, MI vs PBKS HighlightsMumbai Indians - 5 defeats (twice) - 2014 and 2022Royal Challengers Bangalore - 5 defeats - 2019Delhi Capitals - 5 defeats - 2013Deccan Chargers - 5 defeats - 2012Mumbai Indians are the only team to remain winless as Chennai Super Kings, who began the season with 4 defeats on the trot, ended their losing run against Royal Challengers Bangalore on Tuesday.On Wednesday, Mumbai brought back Tymal Mills to aid their struggling bowling attack but the move did not pay dividends on Wednesday as Punjab Kings had a 97-run opening stand between Shikhar Dhawan and Mayank Agarwal as both of them went on to hit fifties.Jasprit Bumrah (1/27) was the only MI bowler who stood out. It has been the case for them this season as Mumbai have failed to provide the support that Bumrah needs with the ball so far.In reply, Rohit Sharma failed to convert his start into a big knock aa the Mumbai skipper has been struggling for form this season. With Ishan Kishan failing early, the pressure of chasing a mammoth total fell on the inexperienced middle-order.However, Dewald Brevis (49), Surykumar Yadav (43) and Tilak Varma (36) helped Mumbai stay in the contest but a weakened lower-middle order meant MI fell short of the finish line by 12 runs.",2022-04-14
147,PBKS hand Mumbai Indians their 5th successive defeat of IPL 2022,"Punjab Kings and Odean Smith held their nerves in a final-over thriller to beat Mumbai Indians by 12 runs at the MCA Stadium in Pune. This was MI's fifth successive defeat in IPL 2022 and this is now their joint worst start in the IPL - in 2014, they had lost their first five matches of the camaign.Odean Smith, who had been smashed for two sixes off the the last two balls by Rahul Tewatia of Rajasthan Royals, bowled the final over once again against MI who needed 22 to secure their first win. Jaydev Unadkat hit Smith for a six off the first ball of the over but Smith bounced back with two wickets to deny the 5-time IPL champions.IPL 2022: Full Coverge | Points TableChasing 199, MI needed a really quick start and Rohit Sharma promised to do that - he hit 3 fours and 2 sixes but fell to Kagiso Rabada for a 17-ball 28. Ishan Kishan, who has not somehow lost his touch after back-to-back fifties in the first two matches this season, perished to Vaibhav Arora as Tilak Varma joined Dewald Brevis in the middle. The two teenagers were in a brutal mood - Brevis hit Rahul Chahar for a four and 4 sixes in his first over while Tilak continued his rich form this season to give bring the MI chase back on track.Brevis and Tilak smashed sixes at will as MI went from 32 for 2 in the 5th over to 116 for 3 in the 11th by the time Brevis fell for 49. Tilak Varma was run out soon after a mix-up with Suryakumar Yadav. Not long after, Kieron Pollard was run out in a similar mix-up, as PBKS clawed back into the contest.IPL 2022, MI vs PBKS HighlightsSuryakumar Yadav was MI's best hope at the stage and he once again showed his class. They missed him for the first two matches but he came back from his injury layoff with back-to-back half-centuries. However, with 22 to get off 8 balls, Suryakumar fell to Kagiso Rabada for a 30-ball 43.After being asked to bat, PBKS skipper Mayank Agarwal was quick to pounce on Mumbai Indians' bowlers even as Shikhar Dhawan decided to be watchful. The two added 97 for the first wicket before Agarwal perished to Murugan Ashwin in the 10th over.Shikhar Dhawan steered the innings nicely after Agarwal's exit for 52 and became the first batter in IPL history to hit 800 boundaries. When he looked set to get a hundred, Basil Thampi outfoxed Dhawan with a slower ball to end his innings for 70.Jonny Bairstow failed for the second match in succession while the in-form Liam Livingstone was done in by a brilliant yorker from Jasprit Bumrah.However, Jitesh Sharma (30 not out off 15 balls) and Shah Rukh Khan (15 off 6 balls) ensured PBKS had a competitive total on a good batting pitch.MI ROCKED EARLYMumbai Indians needed a strong start in a stiff chase and Rohit Sharma, who has been in sluggish IPL form, had started to take the attack to Punjab Kings but he fell in the 4th over of the innings. Kagiso Rabada had conceded 9 runs in his first over but returned for his second to remove the MI skipper. In the very next over, Vaibhav Arora sent back Ishan Kishan as his poor run continued. The young opener started the campaign with two fifties but has since struggled to regain momentum.ROHIT JOINS VIRATRohit Sharma became the second Indian after Virat Kohli to score 10,000 T20 runs when he reached 26 in an aggressive start. However, Rohit t could not carry on for much longer and fell after adding only two more runs to his tally. Kohli is the leading run-scorer in the IPL while Rohit Sharma is third in the list. Rohit has 4 hundreds in T20 Internationals but has so far scored only 1 hundred in the IPL. Rohit has also led MI to 5 IPL titles and continues to remain the most successful captain in IPL.AB OR BREVIS?Dewald Brevis is just a few days short of turning 19 but the way he smashed the PBKS bowling attack would have you think otherwise. Brevis had grabbed headlines with his batting style which many have compared with AB de Villiers, another South African powerhitter and one of the legends of the game. In the recent Under-19 World Cup, Brevis was the highest run-scorer and broke Shikhar Dhawan's record for the all-time tally. On Wednesday, Dhawan watched as a hapless PBKS fielder when Brevis took Rahul Chahar apart in his first over for 4, 6, 6, 6 and 6 - Chahar ended up conceding his most expensive over in the IPL.Brevis was cruising to his maiden fifty and had a lucky escape when he was dropped at third man off the bowling of Odean Smith - the ball rolled over the rope and the South African teenager moved to 49. However, he fell in the next ball, one short of what was a well-deserved half-century.Brevis's wicket brought another as Tilak Varma was run out for 36 (20 balls) following a mix-up with Surykumar Yadav.SURYA NAMASKARSuryakumar Yadav sat out of the first two matches for Mumbai Indians because he was recovering from an injury. He came back with a bang and hit two half-centuries in his first two matches of the season. On Wednesday, he played another crucial role for MI with a quickfire 43 after being involved in two run-outs (of Tilak Varma and Kieron Pollard).With 22 needed off 8 balls, Kagiso Rabada removed Surykumar with MI needing 22 off 8 balls.MAYANK ON FIREMayank Agarwal had an indifferent start to the IPL this year but on Wednesday, he was at his fluent best against Mumbai Indians. The PBKS captain was in an aggressive mood after being asked to bat by Rohit Sharma. While his opening partner Shikhar Dhawan took his time in the middle, Agarwal wasted no time and hammered 52 off 32 balls - the innings was studded with 6 fours and 2 sixes. However, a hurricane knock from Agarwal was cut short by Murugan Ashwin.UNADKAT, BUMRAH STRIKEPunjab Kings had raced away to a brilliant start and Rohit Sharma looked worried. Mumbai Indians desperately needed to stop the rampaging PBKS batters. Mayank Agarwal and Shikhar Dhawan had taken their side to an explosive start and then there the likes of Jonny Bairstow and Liam Livingstone to come. However, Jaydev Unadkat and Jasprit Bumrah made their impact after M Ashwin snared Agarwal.Unadkat deceived Bairstow with a slower ball to send him back while Bumrah's searing yorker accounted for the dangerous and in-form Livingstone.DHAWAN BLASTS OFFShikhar Dhawan is the second highest run-scorer in the history of the IPL but this season, he was yet to blow hot for PBKS. He started off watchfully but teed off after Mayanak Agarwal's exit. Dhawan became the first batter in IPL to hit 800 boundaries before he fell for a 50-ball 70 including 5 fours and 3 sixes. This was Dhawan's first half-century for PBKS and the innings helped set the platform for Jitesh Sharma to play a fantastic cameo.MI BOWLERS STRUGGLEThere were patches of brilliance from MI's bowlers - like Unadkat's slower ball to remove Bairstow and Bumrah's yorker to ensure there were no Liam fireworks. However, if Rohit Sharma thought there would be some respite for his bowlers after Dhawan's dismissal, he would be left frustrated again as Jitesh Sharma came out all guns blazing as PBKS stormed towards to 198 for 5 off their 20 overs.",2022-04-13

We have less than 100 employees in Russia. Working with our clients, we are in the process we’ve initiated, how we can transition some of that work, all of that work outside of Russia,” Infosys CEO Salil Parekh told reporters during the Q4 earnings briefing.Parekh categorically added: “We have no work with any Russian client today. And we have no plans for any work with any Russian client going ahead.” Its operations in Russia had come under the scanner following UK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak’s call to companies to boycott the country after President Vladimir Putin ordered troops into Ukraine.

150,ISIS terrorist gets whole-life sentence for stabbing to death UK MP,"An ISIS-supporting terrorist who stabbed a veteran British parliamentarian to death at a constituency meeting was on Wednesday handed a whole life sentence by a UK court.Ali Harbi Ali, a 26-year-old man of Somali heritage, was arrested by police in Essex, south-east England, in October last year after he had stabbed Sir David Amess more than 20 times. He appeared at the Old Bailey court in London for a sentencing hearing after a jury found him guilty of the murder of the Conservative Party member of Parliament for Southend West.""His (David Amess) loss is one of national significance,"" Justice Nigel Sweeney said, handing Ali a whole life sentence which means that his time behind bars is unlimited.The judge said the terror attack had ""struck at the heart of our democracy"" and that Sir David was ""a man of the greatest substance"" who had ""done nothing whatsoever"" to justify the attack on him.Also Read: | British lawmaker David Amess stabbed to death in church""The defendant has no remorse or shame for what he has done, quite the reverse,"" he added.Earlier, Ali told the court during his trial that he had no regrets about the killing, saying the MP deserved to die because he had voted in Parliament for airstrikes on Syria in 2014 and 2015.""If I thought I did anything wrong, I wouldn't have done it,"" he told the jury.The defiant attacker also refused to stand in court ""on religious grounds"", when jurors delivered their verdicts on Monday after just 18 minutes deliberating.""Our amazing husband and father has been taken from us in an appalling and violent manner,"" David Amess’ family said in a statement.""We shall get over this tragedy. It breaks our hearts to know that our husband and father would have greeted the murderer with a smile of friendship and would have been anxious to help. How sickening to think about what happened next. It is beyond evil,"" they said.The trial heard how the Tory lawmaker was killed in a ""vicious and frenzied"" attack that was ""an assassination for terrorist purposes"".The court heard how the attacker had researched a number of potential high-profile political targets, including government ministers Michael Gove and Dominic Raab and Opposition Leader Sir Keir Starmer, before settling on Amess.“During this trial, we have heard how Sir David came to cross paths with a terrorist who had a settled plan to carry out an attack in the UK. It is clear that the man who begins a life sentence today is a cold, calculated and dangerous individual,” said Matt Jukes, the Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner and Head of Counter Terrorism Policing.“His attack was stopped by two Essex Police Constables who apprehended this dangerous man, whilst he was still armed with the knife he had used to kill Sir David. Their actions were nothing short of heroic, and they undoubtedly prevented others from being harmed...None of that, sadly, can change the tragedy of Sir David’s murder,” he said.The counter-terror official urged the public to play their part in tackling terrorism by staying vigilant and trusting their instincts.",2022-04-13
151,BJP doesn’t have faith in CBI: TMC on saffron party’s ‘fact-finding’ team to probe Nadia rape case,"The Trinamool Congress has slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party’s decision to form a five-member committee to visit the site of the alleged rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl in Nadia in West Bengal to enquire into the incident. TMC leader Kunal Ghosh said that the move shows that “the BJP does not have faith in CBI”.The five-member committee will be an all-women team and they have been asked to submit its report at the earliest to BJP president JP Nadda.In a statement, the BJP said, “BJP National President Jagat Prakash Nadda has nominated a five-member fact-finding committee to visit the place of rape and murder of minor at Hanskhali, Nadia, West Bengal.”In response, Trinamool Congress leader and former MP Kunal Ghosh questioned the need for a political party's team to do a report, even with the CBI carrying on an investigation. He went on to state that the BJP's move indicates that the party does not have faith in the CBI."" The CBI is investigating the case. CBI is a central agency. (This) clearly shows that the BJP does not have faith in CBI. One more thing could happen that they want to impose the party line on the CBI. Hence, they are sending a fact-finding team,"" said Kunal Ghosh.This is not the first time the BJP has formed a team to probe an incident in Bengal. Earlier, the party had sent a fact-finding team to Birbhum to prepare a report on the Bagtui violence.A 14-year-old girl was allegedly raped when she went to a birthday party of local TMC leader Samar Goala's son Braj Gopal Goala (21) on April 5. She died on Sunday.The victim’s family alleged that the body was cremated without an autopsy under pressure from a local Trinamool Congress panchayat leader, whose son is the prime accused in the case. The Bharatiya Janata Party called for a 12-hour bandh in Ranaghat on Monday, demanding justice for the deceased.Even as the public outcry over the case grew, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee raised questions over the reports of the minor girl who was allegedly raped in Nadia district on April 5.“This story they are showing that a minor has died due to rape, will you call it a rape? Was she pregnant or had a love affair? Have they enquired? I have asked the police. They have made arrests. I was told the girl had an affair with the boy,” the CM said.Meanwhile, taking into account serious lapses in the investigation done by the Bengal Police, the Calcutta High Court has ordered a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the case.The CBI should take the case for a “fair investigation into the matter and to instill confidence in the family members of the victim and also the residents of the locality and the state”, the court said in its order.",2022-04-13
152,Raj Thackeray doing BJP's bidding: Sharad Pawar as MNS chief bats for Uniform Civil Code,"NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Wednesday alleged that Raj Thackeray is doing the BJP's bidding, a day after the MNS president batted for the Uniform Civil Code and stressed the need for controlling population growth in the country.Queried about Raj Thackeray's ultimatum to the state government to remove loudspeakers from mosques till May 3, Pawar said, ""the government will think over it seriously"", but didn't elaborate.He also dismissed Raj Thackeray's allegation that he (Pawar) is an atheist. ""I go to temples but don't believe in showing off,"" the NCP chief told reporters.Pawar said his ideals include activist Prabodhankar Thackeray (Raj Thackeray's grandfather), who opposed people trying to profit themselves in the name of gods and religions.“He (Prabodhankar Thackeray) did not disrespect (gods and religion), but he criticised those who took disadvantage of it. We people read the writings of Prabodhankar, but some in his family may not be reading it,” Pawar said in a dig at the MNS chief.Pawar also alleged that attempts are being made to disturb social unity in Maharashtra and communal ideology is being promoted in the state.Addressing a Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) rally in Thane on Tuesday night, Raj Thackeray had said that if the Shiv Sena-led state government did not remove the high-decibel loudspeakers from mosques before May 3, MNS workers would play the Hanuman Chalisa in front of mosques.""It is obvious that we got to hear through his (Raj Thackeray's) speech what the BJP guided him,"" Pawar said.He said the MNS chief did not utter a single word about the BJP but targeted the Nationalist Congress Party- a key constituent in the tripartite Maha Vikas Aghadi government led by Shiv Sena.""He tried to discharge the responsibility which the BJP may have given him,"" Pawar added.Pawar also termed ""childish"" Raj Thackeray's claim that the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had raided the family members of Maharashtra Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar, but not the latter's cousin Supriya Sule, who is the daughter of Pawar senior.Ajit Pawar is the nephew of Sharad Pawar.Also Read: | Case against Raj Thackeray, other MNS workers for brandishing swords at Thane rallyHitting out at the MNS chief, Pawar said that people need not take seriously the statements of a person who makes a statement once in six months or a year.""An attempt is being made to disturb the social unity in Maharashtra and communal ideology is being encouraged. I appeal to people to not fall prey to such steps aimed at jeopardising peace,"" Pawar said.In a swipe, Pawar said he didn't know the exact nature of ""understanding"" between the MNS chief and the BJP.""He (Raj Thackeray) did not speak a single word about it (BJP). What does this mean? But the one who calls himself a politician didn't speak on issues like price rises and unemployment. What does this mean?"" he asked.Pawar was irked when asked about Raj Thackeray's allegation that the ED had raided the family of Ajit Pawar but not Sule, the Baramati MP.""He delivered a childish speech. Why should it be talked about? If something happens in the family of Ajit Pawar, it means it happens to me. Do you think I and Ajit Pawar are different? Aren't Supriya and Ajit cousins? Is this a political allegation? It is a childish allegation,"" he said.Also Read: | MNS chief Raj Thackeray tells Maharashtra govt to remove loudspeakers from mosquesRaj Thackeray had hit out at NCP leaders who accused him of frequently changing his political stand.The MNS chief had also talked about Sharad Pawar walking out of Congress in 1999 raising the ""foreign"" origin of Sonia Gandhi and then aligning with the same party after forming NCP for power.“My opinion on whether Sonia Gandhi should become the prime minister or not is in the public domain. But I want to underline that Sonia Gandhi has said that she was not the prime ministerial candidate. So, the issue was over once she declared it,” Pawar said.Raj Thackeray would not have made the comments had he read about what happened at that time, the NCP chief added.Pawar dismissed Raj Thackeray's comments that he plays caste politics and doesn't take the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.The veteran leader also said that Raj Thackeray's rallies attract large crowds because he uses abusive language and mimics others, which entertain people.Responding to a query, Pawar said it was “objectionable” if BJP leader Kirit Somaiya had handed over the money collected during the 'Save INS Vikrant' campaign from the people to BJP.Pawar said the money could have been given to the fund meant for the welfare of armed forces personnel instead.To a question, the former Union minister said central probe agencies are after leaders of ruling parties in Maharashtra and West Bengal, both non-BJP states.“And it is our mindset to face it (the actions) in both the states,” he added.",2022-04-13

It claimed to show Malaysian Muslims expressing solidarity with Indian Muslims following the violence.On Twitter, one person shared the photo with the text, “Malaysian Muslims protest against attacks on #IndianMuslims.” Hashtags like #IndianMuslimsUnderAttack #IndianMuslimsGenocideAlert accompanied the photo.India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) found that the viral image was from a 2020 anti-CAA protest in Malaysia. The Hizb-ut-Tahrir, an international fundamentalist group, protested in front of the High Commission of India in Kuala Lumpur.With the help of a reverse image search, we found that the viral image has been on several Malaysian news portals since 2020.The Malaysian news portal, “The Khilafah”, published the photograph in a report on March 6, 2020, titled, “Hizb-ut-Tahrir Malaysia: Hizb-ut-Tahrir Demands Modi to Stop Persecution against Muslims in India”.Per the report, the Hizb-ut-Tahrir Malaysia (HTM), an Islamist organisation in Malaysia, demonstrated against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in India in 2020.The protest occurred at the High Commission of India in Kuala Lumpur to hand over a memorandum of protest to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, condemning discrimination against Muslims in the backdrop of the CAA.The Hizb-ut-Tahrir also reported on this protest on its website, where it confirmed handing over a memorandum of protest to the Indian High Commission in March 2020. You can read the group’s press release on the matter here.Following incidents of communal violence during Ram Navami, hashtags like #IndianMuslimsUnderAttack have trended and continued to trend. But while verifying the facts of this story, we did not find any news reports on Malaysian Muslim groups expressing solidarity with Indian Muslims through protests.Thus, we concluded that this 2020 photo of an anti-CAA protest in Kuala Lumpur was not related to recent incidents of communal violence in India.(With inputs from Sanjana Saxena in Lucknow)The number of crows determines the intensity of the lie.",2022-04-13

It was barely 200 meters away. Why was the body cremated without an autopsy?The Calcutta High Court on Tuesday handed over the probe to the CBI.“We have examined the case diary. I have also considered the issues mentioned by the plaintiff's lawyer. We felt that there were serious flaws in some of the key areas of the investigation. We cannot ignore the fact that the accused is the son of a powerful leader of the ruling party,” the court said.“The information in the case diary indicates that the victim's family has been threatened. Lack of any medico-legal certificate, autopsy report, death certificate, concealment of facts and loss of evidence create suspicion. The state government's lawyer said there was no cremation ground in the village and no death certificate. However, this information does not seem to be accurate,” the court said.Also Read: | TMC MP Mahua Moitra condemns rape-murder of Bengal teen as Mamata Banerjee blames victim",2022-04-13
