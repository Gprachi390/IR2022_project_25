1,Punjab CM Bhagwant Mann slams opposition for criticising MoU with Delhi,"Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann on Tuesday lashed out at the opposition parties, asking them to desist from issuing unfounded, illogical, frivolous and politically motivated statements criticising the AAP government’s recent landmark decisions.In a video message, Bhagwant Mann chided the Shiromani Akali Dal President Sukhbir Singh Badal for unleashing propaganda against the state government’s recent initiatives to rejuvenate the health and education sectors on Delhi model.Advising Sukhbir Badal, the CM said,”Healthy criticism is always welcomed but criticism for the sake of just criticism and political survival is highly deplorable.”Bhagwant Mann said the Akali Dal leadership was bereft of any constructive political agenda and hell bent on tarnishing AAP's image, which was voted to power with a thumping majority, thus decimating both Akali Dal and Congress parties from the Punjab polity.Bhagwant Mann rued that Akali Dal was making unnecessary hue and cry over the ‘Knowledge Sharing Agreement’ (KSA) in the field of Health & Education with the Delhi government.“Had the Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal, which ruled Punjab for 44 years, done something tangible for the welfare of the people and prosperity of the state, they would not have to face such humiliation"", he said.Further, Bhagwant said Sukhbir Badal should have patience at least for some time as AAP government had not completed its 44 days while the Congress remained in power for long period of over 25 years and Akali Dal ruled for 19 years.""Sukhbir Badal should not mislead the people by referring to false documents with regard to the KSA besides befooling the people spreading canards about Punjab’s AAP government being run from Delhi"", the CM said, adding that Sukhbir Badal had gone to China to forge a collaboration for power generation from paddy straw and his father Parkash Singh Badal had entered into several agreements in different fields with Ontario province of Canada. He questioned Sukhbir whether their government is run by the Chinese government or Ontario province.Read | AAP MLA welcomes Punjab govt’s decision to withdraw arrest warrants against farmersTaking MLA Partap Singh Bajwa to cudgels, the CM asked him to refrain from baseless accusations for sake of political bashing and reminded him the time when their party’s former chief minister was ordering posting and transfers of high-ups like Chief Secretary, DGP and senior bureaucrat at the instance of his foreign guest.“You were writing letters to the Chief Minister at that time showing displeasure over his autocratic style of functioning but later you too was seen having lunch and dinner with him”, the CM reminded Bajwa.Training guns at Navjot Sidhu, the CM said that first of all Sidhu should get his group recognised by the Congress Party, which was protesting against the power agreements at Rajpura and blaming AAP for the same. On Sidhu’s self-styled functioning, the PPCC President Raja Warring has even denounced him, saying that it was not a dharna of the Congress Party.He dared him, saying,”Why didn’t you join as power minister while you could have easily scrapped these power agreements.” He, however, said the AAP Government would soon rescind these agreements in the Punjab Assembly but unfortunately, you won’t be there in the House to witness this historic decision.Reiterating his government’s firm commitment to revive the lost glory of Punjab, Bhagwant Mann said that all of us being Punjabi should make Punjab a frontrunner state in the country.Without mincing any words, Bhagwant Mann said,”The AAP government would strive hard to replicate any worthwhile development model not within the country but across the globe and to ensure all round development of Punjab and the welfare of its residents.”Read | Congress's Raja Warring accuses Arvind Kejriwal of inaction over rising number of farmers' suicide in PunjabALSO READ | Punjab Health Dept bans use of bouquets, plastic bottles in official events",0.9999726023171511

5,Palm oil export ban by Indonesia begins tomorrow | All you need to know,"Indonesia, the world's top palm oil producer, will ban exports of refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) palm olein, which are made by crushing palm fruit and processing it to remove impurities. The ban is set to begin on Thursday.President Joko Widodo announced the ban on Friday to help lower soaring domestic prices.Palm oil is used in everything from cakes, chocolate, margarine and frying fats to cosmetics, soap, shampoo and cleaning products.Small palm oil planters in Indonesia have enjoyed big paycheques in the past year as global vegetable oil prices surged, but these farmers fear they will bear the brunt of the pain from a new export ban coming into effect on Thursday.Local farmers said prices of fresh palm fruit bunches have already plunged in Kampar, Riau Province on Sumatra island, Reuters reported.Indonesia's ban on palm oil exports is unlikely to last more than a month as Jakarta has limited infrastructure to store the surplus oil and the country faces mounting pressure from buyers to resume shipments, industry officials in Indonesia were quoted as saying by Reuters.The shock move has lifted prices of all edible oils and sowed confusion and alarm among palm oil exporters and consumers alike.However, the stock market panic subsided after officials told palm oil executives the ban will only apply to exports of refined, bleached and deodorized (RBD) palm olein, and would not affect flows of crude palm oil or other forms of derivative products.However, Jakarta will widen the ban ""if there is a shortage of refined palm oil,"" according to a presentation the government gave to companies on Monday. RBD palm olein accounts for around 40% of Indonesia's total exports of palm oil products, according to analysts' estimates.Indonesia meets nearly 50 per cent of the total palm oil requirement in India annually.India consumes 22.5 million tonne of edible oil annually, of which 9-9.5 million tonne is met by domestic supplies and the rest by imports. About 3.5-4 million tonne of palm oil is imported by India annually from Indonesia, as per a PTI report.ALSO READ | Palm oil price to go up?
